THREAD: it is meant to be a completion mark i think... lol don't expect extensive reviews ? REPLY: Oh, sure. But this is what I got: 
THREAD: Curious to know, how long is your progress report and how far you are in percentage? REPLY: Here’s an example for mine: <https://github.com/benpcorn/CourseProject/blob/main/Progress_Report.md>  1 page ish. I’m probably 40% through the project 
THREAD: Has anyone emailed the professor before and got a response? or He doesn't usually respond? REPLY: I've asked about grade reports before and got a response in a reasonable amount of time (day). REPLY: I did not get response by email, but got the result reflected in coursera in reasonable time REPLY: Second. He did respond to me last week. REPLY: I emailed him about an issue and got a response super quickly 
THREAD: The technical review is due Sunday or Monday? the reason for question is that the deadlines are usually Sunday but this one seems Monday? REPLY: For me, Coursera is still showing Nov 7 11:59 CST.  If you are seeing a different date I would confirm with TAs/Prof REPLY: Yup I see Monday Nov 8 REPLY: <@U0123KZL1EG> Do check the time as well.. It might be showing 8th Nov as you might be in different time zone than CST.... All the deadlines are CST based... so its actually 7th November 11:59 PM CST.... Which is 8th Nov 12:59 AM EST and so on.... 
THREAD: No one's done any proposal peer reviews yet, right? The project instructions state: &gt; The proposal, progress report, and final documentation will be peer-graded by all of you (with guidance from the instructors). We will later provide more details on the peer-grading process and reviewer functionality on CMT. I'd like feedback sooner rather later tbh... REPLY: yes, the post by the TA mentioned sometime later this week we will get instructions on how to do it.

I got a similar error that I fixed by specifying the encoding as UTF-8 when I opened the corpus file. REPLY: Thank you, I'll try. REPLY: If it's not that, there are specific methods I tried to use that are not available in the auto-grader environment... so I had to recode them using another line 
THREAD: Anyone have any luck passing MP3? REPLY: I just did, much to my surprise. REPLY: Yeah, mine passed. What kind of issue are you having? REPLY: So I'm pretty sure I am implementing the EM steps correctly but after several iterations it appears my doc_topic_prob normalizes to 0,1 for each document given two topics. I.e. every document normalizes to 100% for topic 1 and 0% for topic 0, which is not true. I dont suppose you would be willing to take a look and provide some insight into what I might be missing? REPLY: Yeah, I can take a look

THREAD: I realize it’s a bit late, but is anyone interested in joining my project? It’s an active problem I’m working on at my job in collaboration with a team of student interns and open-source contributors.  1 page overview: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eyat5Aw6uPloQH8svH2M-g3fH3hH6UgXtxoojTL7pH0> Petal taxonomy: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840249663797723146/859519135313690664/PeTaL_Taxonomy_v1_Dec_2020v2.png> Github: <https://github.com/nasa-petal> Project proposal: <https://github.com/nasa-petal/search-engine/blob/main/proposal.docx?raw=true>  Project Description: Build an information system for the following problem: How to identify biology papers that describe various biomimicry functions from a known list of 100 functions, and rank them in order of relevance to a particular biomimicry function. An example would be a paper describing how geckos feet enables them to cling to surfaces, should be given a high relevancy rank for the biomimicry function, “attach temporarily”.  We’ve tried a couple of text-classification approaches to the problem, and have a simple web UI setup, but the goal of this project would be to explore some of the text retrieval and mining approaches to the problem to see if we can achieve better relevancy of results. If we have enough time/people it would be nice to add a feedback piece using implicit feedback of clickthrough data. REPLY: Hey Brandon, I would be interested in joining your project. I’m in PST. would that work? REPLY: Great, I’m in EST but my schedule is pretty flexible, so we can probably make it work.

I am having chills myself :disappointed: REPLY: This is so confusing. I haven't taken it yet. Is there a lot of math? Did people not review the study guide, or was the study guide irrelevant to the test? REPLY: I haven't taken the exam yet.. REPLY: yeah this should not be done while exam is not yet over. add more pressure to others REPLY: I just finished the exam. It makes sense the exam score distribution.  1. The weekly quizzes are really helpful. The exam is not far from the quizzes. But, you should be able to explain why incorrect items in questions are incorrect as well. In my opinion, the exam is asking whether you really understand the quizzes.  2. Understanding models is really important. You do not need to memorize all formulas, but should understand how they work and the meaning of parameters. Questions will challenge you if you cannot interpret them. 
THREAD: I wouldn't mind it being 2 hours and double the number of questions. Oh well! REPLY: I was able to finish in 15-20 minutes and I'm not a fast test taker so I wouldn't worry too much about the time!

THREAD: The probability of A OR B is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of B because terms are mutually exclusive, I think. REPLY: yeah Mat, agreed. as per the answer this statement is not correct. trying to think why this can be incorrect, because if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect. REPLY: <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1082> 
THREAD: any idea why is this correct? REPLY: Yea. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) REPLY: makes sense Rahul. if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect I guess. REPLY: In Uni-gram model, A and B are *independent events,* *not mutual exclusive event*.  *[Independent event]* If A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). For example, what you eat this morning is independent to what score you get in this exam, so P("you eat fish this morning and you get score 100") = P("fish") * P("score 100").  *[Mutual exclusive event]* if A and B are mutually exclusive event, A and B cannot happen at the same time. For example, P("today is Wednesday and today is Friday") = 0.  The first statement is true because in Uni-gram model, A and B are independent events. For example, in Uni-gram model, P("today is Wednesday") = P("today") * P("is") * P("Wednesday") = P("today Wednesday is"), so we don't care about the grammar or context.  The third statement is false because you need to subtract P(A and B). Assume that P(A) = 0.6, and P(B) = 0.5, if you don't subtract P(A and B), then P(A or B) would be 1.1, which is greater than 1. REPLY: Makes so much sense. Thanks <@U020GEPFQ7Q>  REPLY: no problem! REPLY: in unigram model p(w1)+p(w2)+...+p(wn) = 1 so P(A)+P(B) can't be bigger than 1 like 1.1 in your example REPLY: You’re right, thanks! Maybe P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3 would be a better example. P(first word is A or second word is B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.12. And P(first word is A and second word is B) = 0.4*0.3 REPLY: If the third statement is asking when you generate only one word, what is the probability that this word is A or B, then I think the third statement is true. Because in this case, event 1(get A in the first word) and event 2(get B in the first word) are mutually exclusive. So the probability would be P(get A in the first word) + P(get B in the first word)  I think the statements of this question is not clear enough and I’m little confused.

THREAD: I found myself getting a little depressed going through the Recommender Systems content. Nowadays, this is the technology that's being used to push conspiracy theories, quack cures, teenage self-harm, and other nonsense designed to break society.  Can anyone recommend links on ways this can be combatted? For example, are there recommender systems that are driven by more than just user clicks and ratings? What other criteria might they use? REPLY: Sorry, I don't have a good resource for you, but glad you're bringing up this ethical concern. Where do you think the responsibility belongs to address these concerns? Personally, if we say everyone is individually responsible (or for their kids), then I suspect nothing will be done unless it impacts someone's bottom line. REPLY: That's a great question. I'm not nearly as up on ethics as I should be.  Humans naturally seek communities, and a great way to make money is to point them to things they're already interested in. I wonder if some recommendations could be driven not only by clicks but by some measure of "high information content" plus "neutral sentiment". I bet few people would follow those recommendations, though.  For now, I'm curious to see how Facebook's Instagram issues will play out. Will there be lawsuits or legislation, and what effect would it have? My thought is "not much", but we'll see. REPLY: This would make for a good campuswire post. I'm sure the TAs and professor would be able to point to decent resources. REPLY: That's a good idea, thanks. I will.  I attended a session on AI ethics a while back. The speaker listed ethical principles that have a lot of overlap with the principles of human-subject research. For example, give your subjects information about the data you plan to collect on them, and allow them to opt out.  One new principle was model transparency. I don't remember if this applies to general model explainability, or the ability to show a user why a model recommended them a particular item.  In any case, the principles give the user the choice about what to participate in. But with things like recommendation systems there's an additional risk of encouraging addictive behavior. People rarely have uncontrollable cravings to participate in research studies, but giving someone a chance to get lost in echo chambers is much more enticing. I think any approach to addressing issues has to recognize there's an addictive component to current systems. Of course, if that's the component that makes companies money, it's going to take a lot more work to address meaningfully. REPLY: Let me start by saying, I love this discussion!!!! It's so easy to get into the weeds of solving problems, but not so much about the repercussions thereafter. Here is my rambling train of thought on the above.  The opt-in opt-out is probably the most simple solution to any system. Use my data, no don't use my data.... a sign in the front of the store, that says, smile, you're on camera... (e.g. amazon go stores). don't like the convenience, no problem, you can still go to WholeFoods.  Echo chambers are a real threat to citizenship, some countries may prefer it (e.g. China), but what makes sense for a free speech society. when is too much of a good thing (e.g. content I like) a bad thing. Let's say I like watching a particular genre of TV/Movie to the point of Binge watching. Should Netflix be forced to limit my subscription? Or is it enough to provide an on screen widget that tells me my viewing habits. (e.g. hours this week per show / genre, etc). Probably the latter could still make me watch less, but would it make me cancel my subscription, maybe? REPLY: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFRewkdDT2g> REPLY: I think it's also important to note that these positive feedback systems are creating echo chambers no only online in social media, but in any opinion-oriented medium. And not just explicitly opinion-based websites: look into Larry Sanger's (one of the founder's of Wikipedia) opinion on what the politically-oriented articles of Wikipedia have become). News websites (even formerly reputable ones) and social networks all drive people toward the same conclusion: people seeking confirmation bias because it feels good. From alcohol/drugs, to sex, to calorie-dense fatty/sugary foods, all the way to confirmation bias, our own primal desires push us to overindulge in these behaviors.  Specifically regarding the low-cost driven echo chambers: I suppose in past generations, the extent to which group-think was able to persist was primarily a function of the size of groups and cost of communication between potential members. Now that the cost of finding people who think exactly like you do is essentially zero, I don't know how possible it is to avoid the fractionating.  Another consideration I've thought about: to what extent is it moral to make people do something that they don't want to do, just because you think it will be better for them? Obviously most smokers are addicted to cigarettes and we know they would be healthier (and better off financially) if they didn't smoke. Does that mean it's moral to make them stop? I'm not entirely sure I know how to answer that question, but the similarities between that question and the question of regulating feedback systems is noteworthy. REPLY: Re: echo chambers, I thought Ground News’ curated “Blindspot for the Left/Right” concept was interesting in pushing up news stories that you’re less likely to see depending on political lean.  <https://ground.news/blindspot|https://ground.news/blindspot>  I used to follow pundits that I disagree with on Twitter thinking it would help with filter bubbles, but I don’t think this is a good approach anymore. Too noisy. REPLY: <@U012ZBEMAKW> specifically regarding "conspiracy theories", I'm very reluctant to think that it is a good move to stop any idea in particular because of one main issue: who decides what is a "conspiracy theory" and what isn't?  Remember when Covid definitely had a natural origin? (even though any honest actor knew the lab leak hypothesis was a plausible explanation all along). Remember when Iraq definitely had nuclear weapons? Remember when Assad definitely gassed his own people?  I could go on and on and on with dozens of major examples, but my point is pretty simple. Sometimes the difference between a conspiracy theorist and an unorthodox thinker is a few years passing. To think we've reached our zenith as humanity and that the intellectual elite will never be wrong about something in the future is naive. Preserving the ability to speak out--even if it is "conspiracy theories"-- is a necessity.  And perhaps more importantly, do you really trust big brother to never have incentives misaligned to the point that the person or group deciding whether something is "true" or not might have something to hide or a financial stake to buttress?  I know I don't. We have anti-pollution laws that have teeth specifically because we realize that the desire to keep you job and become more successful professionally is a strong incentive that has to be counteracted with a stronger punitive policy. In the same way, we should expect that the "fact-checkers" can have misaligned incentives at least occasionally.  There's a reason that the protection of free speech in the first amendment. REPLY: <@U028YQ2C0T1> I use ground news semi-frequently! I think it's a great resource! I especially think the most obvious bias becomes obvious looking at their website: omission bias. Looking at the different sides of the political aisle covering different things (e.g. team red covering the increase in illegal immigration and team blue covering the capital riot) makes the bias pretty obvious in totality. It makes you realize that there are (at least) two different realities emerging, predominantly brought about by the fragmentation of new coverage. REPLY: Maybe this rule is best: my freedom ends where harm to you begins.  As far as recommender systems go, the Instagram case seems like a good fit to this rule. Children don't have the same type of agency as older people, and Facebook appeared to know their product increased the risk of self-harm and other ill effects.  For adults, maybe the best thing is just to understand what companies use recommender systems to do: keep you clicking on their content as much as possible, no matter what. But that's easy not to think about, and so the US has quick spread of ideas like taking ivermectin for COVID or that voter suppression is needed to fight nonexistent mass voter fraud. (Voter suppression should count as infringement of free speech, if it doesn't already).  The case of Iraqi WMDs is an interesting one. The IAEA had found no evidence of Iraq reviving a nuclear program, but by that point the US media had echo-chambered itself into support for war. No Youtube needed!  I'd like to hear more about what issues other countries face. But now I'll stop breaking my rule to avoid politics in non-political forums. REPLY: I completely agree that children don't have the same agency as adults, but I don't know how reasonable that rule is for adults when the adults being harmed in this situation are consenting to the "harm." At least currently, that rule is inconsistent with how society treats other products (e.g. cigarettes, alcohol, fast food, etc). REPLY: but yes, I would be curious to hear the opinions of some non-Americans!

THREAD: Important announcement by Prof. Zhai in Campuswire pinned post yesterday regarding  change in policy for quiz deadline and penalty.  ```Dear All,   My apologies for the confusion caused by conflicting information in the new Late Quiz Penalty Policy post here and one of the TA answers in a previous question about Quiz penalties.   The confusion has mostly come from the somewhat different policies that we were expected to use for the online MCS students and the on-campus students in the mixed class. Historically, in order to accommodate the unpredictable schedules of our online MCS students, the department suggested removing all the late penalties for quizzes as long as the work was submitted before a "hard deadline". However, such a policy does not help students plan their work, often causing accumulation of too much work at the end. Moreover, it's also not the typical policy that has been applied to our on-campus students, which can cause confusion.   Thus we decided to revise the policy and give an "incremental penalty" for late submission of quizzes, which can help avoid too much work being potentially accumulated right before an exam.  Meanwhile, we still would like to do as much as we can to accommodate those who might have an expected challenge that would prevent them from finishing a quiz (or an MP) on time by granting extensions in a case by case manner. So if you have encountered any unexpected challenge or interruption in your study that affects your capacity of finishing a quiz or MP on time, please do request an extension by posting a "private note" on campuswire with an explanation of your situation.   Unfortunately, I didn't communicate clearly with all the TAs about this. Sorry for this confusion.   Due to this confusion, we will not enforce the New Late Quiz Penalty for Quizzes 1 through 4; for those quizzes you can still submit your quiz and receive full credit up to the Hard Deadline (end of Week 7).   For Quizzes 5 onward, however, the New Late Quiz Penalty Policy will be enacted: if you submit your quiz before the item deadline on Coursera, no penalty is deducted. If you submit your quiz after the item deadline but before the Hard Deadline, a daily penalty of 5% will be deducted. Please note that this new Late Quiz Penalty Policy only applies to Quizzes! The MP Late Penalty will NOT change, it will remain 50% penalty after the deadline.   Thanks,   -Cheng``` REPLY: I'm still confused over this, does this mean we get penalized when we submit after the hard deadline (week 7)? Also we are currently in week 5, it would make more sense to let this be effective starting from quiz 6 onwards 
THREAD: <!here> if you agree to not have the deadline of quizzes and MPs on the same week as lecture and prefer 1-2 weeks after, please :+1: on my post on <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/795>  Thanks.

THREAD: Did anyone else have their webhook for MP1 fail with a 401 error? The error message is “Github account not found.” REPLY: I have a different issue - looks like it is asking me to login with my email id to livedata lab and then not finding my account.  I can't create a new account with the same email id either.  Anyone else faced this problem?  Is there a way to reset the password? REPLY: <@U01GT3E9M3Q> I'm facing the same issue. Haven't found a solution yet though. I suggest we post it here in case we find any. EDIT: My issue was I forgot to check the checkbox for “repo” scope upon generating the token on my GitHub account.

THREAD: Anyone else having issues installing metapy? REPLY: Yeah, I was able to get it to work by using PyCham, then setting my PyCharm virtual environment to Python2.7 then open the MP in PyCharm and hover over metapy and have PyCharm install it for me REPLY: Thanks, I'll give that try REPLY: No problem, best of luck! REPLY: It looks like going to 2.7 was the solution- thanks for the help REPLY: I installed miniconda and was able to create env from there and install metapy REPLY: I was able to get it working on python 3.5 (if you download anaconda, switching between environments is very easy from either the command line or the anaconda launchpad)
