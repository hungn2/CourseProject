THREAD: How to Grab User Input from HTML Code and Use it For Python Code? I was wondering about how we can use an HTML variable and use it in our Python code. In our chrome extension, we are using HTML code to grab the user's input, and then we plan on using this input as a query for our ranking in our final project. However, we are very confused on how to grab the user's input in HTML and use this same input into our Python file, where our ranking code is located at. Any help would be greatly appreciated. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Perhaps you can try with an HTML form?

THREAD: How to submit final project to CMT? Right now, I was just going to put:   Project Code: <github link> Documentation: Included in ReadMe Presentation: <link>  inside the abstract on CMT. Would that be good, or do we need to put it somewhere else? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: To be safe I would also put all deliverables (source code, readme, and presentation) in your github repository.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #1730 says to include the link to your presentation in your final report. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Note that the question you are referring to was not answered by a TA or instructor. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same question.

THREAD: Presentation Video Are all team members required to speak in the final presentation video? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Per section 8 in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview instruction there is no such specific requirement that tells all team members required to speak in final presentation.  For final presentation I believe it can be a team decision if all team members want to participate or it can be just one speaker. A team introduction would be nice though to callout each team members' name irrespective of who is presenting.  
THREAD: Ranker.score function infinitely running in server I implemented a ranking function using metapy and it works fine locally, but when I try to run it through my django server to connect with my frontend it gets stuck whenever I call ranker.score. I have tried switching to python 3.5 and tried changing to different ranking functions, but it still does not work. Has anyone resolved something similar or have recommendations for other backend servers that worked for them, thanks? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team initially faced a similar situation when trying to run the ExpertSearch server code using python in command line and I believe it was getting stuck in the ranker.score function. But when we switched using the `gunicorn` launcher it was working fine. Although as part of our overall implementation we explored libraries compatible with python3.9 and had to eventually move away from metapy.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team also faced this issue and found the underlying reason to be related to this issue: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/1308 . Metapy uses Pybind for the binding in the built in scoring functions and there appear to be deadlock issues with the version that Metapy uses. We could not get Django or Flask to work and went with the recommendation from that github issue, which was to use Falcon....and this did work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team also faced the similar situation while running the application on the local. Changing the app.run code to  app.run(threaded=False) helped. The application ran fine while deploying on Heroku using Gunicorn.  Referred to the following post from Github: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/issues/206  
THREAD: Final Project Documentation in README? Is there a requirement for where we put our final project documentation? Are we allowed to just put it in the README, or does it need to be elsewhere? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Per Section 7 in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview the Final project report need to be a written documentation and must cover all the elements mentioned in the section.   It can be in the same pdf format report like how we submitted the Project Proposal and Project Progress. However, I believe one team asked in post #1698 if they can put the project documentation in a README and TA responded that it is allowed too as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it. A nice benefit of README is it can be easily updated unlike pdf.   So, you can either create a Final Project pdf report and put it in the same place like the previous two project docs or the final report can be in the form of README too. Either way the report should cover all the elements mentioned in section 7 of project overview. I think it will be more like a team decision if they prefer pdf as final report or README. Both are allowed.   Also make sure you include link of the tutorial video presentation in your report as mentioned in Section 8 in the above Coursera link.    
THREAD: Final Project Video Requirement  What are some requirements for the final project video?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "At the end of the semester, every project team will be asked to submit a short tutorial presentation (e.g., a voiced ppt presentation) to explain how the developed software is to be used. The presentation must include (1) sufficient instructions on how to install the software if applicable, (2) sufficient instructions on how to use the software, and (3) at least one example of use case so as to allow a grader to use the provided use case to test the software. There is no strict length requirement for this video submission, but you should target at 5~10 minutes. A presentation shorter than 5 minutes is unlikely detailed enough to help users understand how to use the software, whereas a longer video than 10 minutes might be too long for impatient users. However, feel free to produce a longer presentation if needed. The tutorial presentation would be graded based on 1) completion of the presentation (10%); and 2) result of testing the software by graders (10%). If the software passes the test (i.e., is working as expected), full points will be given; otherwise, points will be deducted from the 10% allocated to the “result of testing the software by graders.” " REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: See Section 8 on https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  which is also shared on the below response.  Both documentation and presentation requirements are captured in that coursera link.  Regarding how you can upload and share the video link, see #1730 
THREAD: Final Project Documentation File Format? As the title suggests, I read the overview and know what needs to be in it. However, should the documentation be a Readme file that is seen at beginning of the repo or just a PDF similar to the previous assignments?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If the final project documentation is README then the best place for it to keep is at the root level of the repo (like all the standard READMEs) so git can default display it for you. Generally README are best displayed in `README.md` format and here is one sample repo:  https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme  Also See #1698

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Shruti,  The project documentation needs to be uploaded in the GitHub repo as already done for the proposal and progress report. For the Video Recording , you can upload it on GitHub (if size is permitted) , else you can refer to the following campuswire post for the options to upload: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1730 and share the link in the ReadMe or a text or pdf document in GitHub (thats what we did). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: 1. Where are we supposed to upload the project documentation?  >>>The Project Documentation can be put in the same place where your team been putting the Project Proposal and Project Progress documents. Final project Report would be just another document.  However, one team asked if the project Documentation can be on README and the TA answered it can be on README too as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it. See #1698  2. And how do we share the Link for Project Video Recording? >>> The project video you can upload in any University provided video sharing resources and then add the presentation link either in the README or the Final ProjectReport whatever documentation you are providing.

So it should be "=" and not "<"  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The explanation is misleading.  You may regard it as a random variable, as firstly, you need to select a distribution \theta_k based on p_k.   Actually, \theta_k is a parameter / id / name of a distribution.  Consider a mixed model, given a \theta_i, you have a distribution. For sure, all the possible probalities sum to 1.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/9ceb39e6-a0a3-4c74-8e98-da47644e016a/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The sum should be 1 which is one of the constraints on PLSA.

THREAD: Can I reschedule if I run into technical issues with proctorU? I didn't have much experience with proctorU that I chose the last time slot available (9:50 PM). However, I just heard that it's possible to run into some technical issues while setting up proctorU, which can potential take a long time and may let me to fail to open the exam within the time window. This is making me nervous as its consequence seems pretty severe.   I'm wondering if I would be able to get a reschedule if unfortunate events like that happen and I couldn't access the exam by 10 PM tomorrow? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Send a private msg to TAs. It is possible. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had an issue where I didn't have my ID and had a late time lost. I was able to acquire my ID (20+ minutes) and take the exam with full time because the exam itself stays open until midnight I believe.  I did have to disconnect from the first proctor I had and wait for a new one, but still it was all fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can reschedule the exam for $8 to an earlier time to account for technical issues. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I originally had the last slot for exam 1 and decided to reschedule it a few hours earlier for the same concern. It's better to reschedule it now while you still can, then asking for an extension which you might not get. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ProctorU is actually pretty lenient as long as you check in at the right time. Also, they will provide technical support on the window. However, I would recommend choosing an earlier time slot to take the exam if you are really worried about it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I disconnected with the proctor personnel one time and the proctor pages closed suddenly. I tried to reconnect and the same person connected with me. We did the ID and room checking for a second time and continued with the exam. So don't worry, proctor staff will help you and just try to reconnect if any technical issue happen. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought the exam closed by 10pm CST regardless. Interesting if you were able to start at 9:50pm and take it past 10pm CST.  You can reschedule for a $12 fee (I noticed others mention $8; perhaps in past sessions). 
THREAD: Practice quiz 9 question 10 Practice quiz 9 question 10 says "Which of the following is TRUE about the mixture model?", and you have two options:  - Words of the document are drawn from a mixture of topics where the mixing weight depends on different documents.  - Topics are a mixture of words where the mixing weight depends not only on the topics but also the documents.  The correct answer is the first option. Can someone please explain why?  AFAIK, the mixing weight of topics does not depend on the document but it's a parameter of the model that doesn't change so I'm not sure why the first option is the correct (as a matter of fact, I'd also say the second option isn't correct either) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is hard to understand. However, the meaning is correct though.  See below in pdf 9.1. We have topic and a background topic. They are mixed together.  \theta_d is related with the document d. It means different document, \theta_d may be different.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/86929ae8-2492-43e8-97e4-62fea10c3af1/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For the first option, we draw words from a a) mixture of topics (from the mixture model basically), and this mixing factor depends on the pi - recall that pi is related to a specific document AND topics (d,j) In the second option, a topic is nothing but a Unigram LM in our cases, where the mixing weight (probability of each word) only depends on the topic, if you recall.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had discussed this with Professor Zhai. According to our discussion, The first question i.e. document clustering shouldn't be in Week-9 since rather it should be Week-10. The thin line is Document Clustering vs Mixture Model. In Document Clustering once a distribution is chosen using prior, all words are drawn from the same distribution. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 6]: From my understanding, it depends on whether the you look from word level first or document level first when generating the document. - In question 2, it requires using mixture model. You generate each word from all topic models then all words are included in the document. The calculation process is shown in the picture attached in your question.  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.56.56%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0fe8f08c-2fd1-494d-9a0c-c88963cd66b0/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.56.56%20AM.png)  - Question 1 is actually using text clustering model. You make decision about which topic the document belongs to first. Then all words in the document generate from the topic you selected in the first step. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.57.37%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a01fd65b-4bba-40b5-9c4e-17bfbc77d072/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.57.37%20AM.png)  In reality, the outputs of the two models are different and which one to use depends on what you are looking for. Here is an website I found that explains this. https://iksinc.online/2016/05/16/topic-modeling-and-document-clustering-whats-the-difference/ - Topic modeling is more filtering out topics that associate with clusters of words. - Clustering is more to group document and measure document similarity.

Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: According to SLM model, the sequence info is ignored. For more info, see below from Professor.  > While there are many different kinds of SLMs, we are particularly interested in the simplest one, i.e., the unigram language models. This model corresponds to a multinomial distribution over words. According to this model, a piece of text is "generated" by generating each word independently. As a result, the joint probability of generating all the words in a document D=w1 w2 ... wn is simply the product of generating each individual word, i.e., p(D)=p(w1)p(w2)...p(wn).      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: For the third option the likelihood will be squared. i.e. P = (p(w1)^2)(p(w2)^2)... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It doesn't have to be a unigram model. Think about a bigram model, we can only get w1w1 pattern in "w1w1w2w2...wnwn".

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is just an example of binary classification . This just tells based on the score if d>0 this means the ratio P(θ1|d) > P(θ2|d) i.e the possibility on having the document being part of θ1 category is more than θ2 . In case of multiple labels, you can compare  the same by finding the Posterior probability of having θs given d    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you for the response, I was a bit confused by the notation, should it be a score(d, θ1) rather than just a score(d)? I was just wondering why θ1 is assumed to be the top and if there is a convention of it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here the score is an indication of the comparison between the probability of two categories. If the score is positive, it means the probability of $$\theta_1$$ is larger than $$\theta_2$$, and the classifier will predict $$\theta_1$$.   Here I think it is used to introduce Logistic Regression, which is a binary classifier. Therefore, it does not address the problem with 3 or more categories.  
THREAD: Practice Quiz 10 Q2 Hi  I was wondering if someone can explain this question? (I am a bit lost about what does it mean by the maximum likelihood of a set of documents? is this the likelihood of the occurrences of the words or is it something else? What is the context of the likelihood of the set of documents?)  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-12-02%20at%2011.34.13%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c87b8634-f2b8-4cef-8cbe-963fa527c133/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-02%20at%2011.34.13%20PM.png)  Thank you in advance REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Although in the question it mentions "set of documents" - the scenarios mentioned in the multiple choice option is for a single document . I did not notice this unless you explicitly pointed it out :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ah, I see, so is it supposed to be the likelihood of word occurences in a document?   if so CMIIW, doubling every word should also not change it right? (it will be canceled out isn't it?) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: that's the way I interpreted  No, it will change - suppose d ={w1 w2}  So, ML here is 0.5 * .0.5 = 0.25  Now, d ={w1 w1 w2 w2 } So, the ML is  square(0.5) * square(0.5)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Set of documents means the entire collection . Each document has log likelihood and sum of  likelihood for all the documents should be the likelihood for the entire collection REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The maximum likelihood does not change since we are taking the product corresponding to each term and the order of the terms is irrelevant (i.e., does not change the product corresponding to those terms) 
THREAD: Do CS510 a good choice to take right after this course? Or any other recommendation? Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: They are independent. If you want to know more about similar things. The ABM is a good choice. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Maybe CS 447 Natural Language Processing if you are interested in the related topics, but it is offered in the fall semester.  Alternatively, ABM could be a good one.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Depending on you are on on-campus program or online program your options may vary.   For online students, options are much lesser so try to see the breadth requirements and advance course requirements. You have to take 4 courses from 4 breadths and 3 advance coursework.. remaining 1 can be elective. But at times a breadth coursework (like Deep Learning, Scientific Visualization)  can satisfy both breadth and advance course requirement at the same time, in in that case you have take more courses from elective or from same breadth. CS510 isn't available for online students but  CS 447 Natural Language Processing will be good option if someone want to explore more on NLP.  For on-campus program you have more available options and there might be a different coursework completion requirements. if CS 510: Advanced Information Retrieval available for on-campus student (should be) then it might be a good advance coursework option if you want to deep dive more into test retrieval. CS 447 Natural Language Processing will be good option too but not an advance coursework.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: @Jiecheng Zhao what's ABM stands for? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for the info! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ABM = Advanced Bayesian Modelling REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ...and CS410 satisfies the prereq. requirement for CS510

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We don't *need* to memorize but then somehow (?) need to know the relationships present in the formulas. 
THREAD: Week 11 Practice Quiz Question 11 Explanation How does the fact that the next closest data is D2 indicate that there is a tie?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1bca13aa-8d9b-4df6-8df3-0490a6c52555/image.png)  Here is Question 10 to give context:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3c1d2a81-f688-48be-955e-748eddd36b09/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The first closest data is D1 which is 0.85, the second closest is D2 which is 0.7. One label 1 and another label 0 which conclude the answer. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your response. I do understand that part. My confusion is how the similarity values between documents indicate what label a document is.    Suppose in the D6 row, the values for D2 and D4 were switched, so the similarity between D6 and D2 is 0.1, and the similarity between D6 and D4 is 0.7. What would the prediction be in this case?  My guess is that the prediction would be 1, because k=2 indicates that I must pick the 2 closest neighbors, and both would be labeled 1. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This table here is a symmetric matrix since the distance between D6 and D2 are same as D2 and D6. So, you can not just switch 2 row values.. you need to make similar adjustment on the D2 row, D6 column & D4 row , D6 column as well . ( from your example ) .  Re: *My guess is that the prediction would be 1, because k=2 indicates that I must pick the 2 closest neighbors, and both would be labeled 1.* Yes, that's correct ..     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: *My confusion is how the similarity values between documents indicate what label a document is.* - Read column wise , ignore diagonal values , sort in descending order based on similarity value  - Identify top K documents and mark their labels , it can be either 0 or 1  - Whichever counts more, that is the category of the observed document , for tie - it can be either label.     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So in the scenario I came up with, the prediction would be 1 right? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nice catch, and thanks for pointing it out! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Answered in #1500

From the bayesian inference we know that, $$P(\theta_{1} | d_3) = \frac{P(d_3 | \theta_{1}) * P(\theta_1)}{P(d_3)} = \frac{P(w_3 | \theta_1) * P(w_4 | \theta_1) * P(\theta_1)}{P(d_3)}$$, so my question is how to compute $$P(d_3)$$ here since I've tried plugging in $$P(d_3)$$ as $$P(w_3) * P(w_4)=\frac{3}{12} * \frac{1}{12}$$ and it's obviously not working though..  I'm just curious on how to get the value $$\frac{3}{7}$$. Thanks for any help! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: P(d3) = P(w3| θ1) * P(w4|θ1) * P(θ1) +  P(w3| θ2) * P(w4|θ2) * P(θ2)  Think that d3 can either be part of θ1 or θ2 , so P(d3) is the total Posterior probability of P(θ1|d3) +  P(θ2|d3)  Now, you plug your numbers like below  P(w3|θ1) = 3/(6+4) <--- |T1| =6 and |V| =4  P(w4|θ1) = 1/(6+4) P(w3|θ2) = 2/(6+4) P(w4|θ2) = 2/(6+4) P(θ1) = 0.5 P(θ2) = 0.5  You should get 3/7 now  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Was answered in #1558

Abstractive is the future, specially the different HuggingFace Transform algorithms, but it requires much more study, analysis, and tuning to find the right parameters for big text such as transcripts (it would be a good exercise after the exams).   After testing different extractive options I decided to use a step by step process using NLTK and PageRank: pre-processing, word and sentence embedding, padding, similarity matrix, cosine distance and PageRank for the sentences.  I will soon share the code in this group after some tests. Feel free to provide feedback about the summarized results.  
THREAD: Uploaded grades + reminder to post on Campuswire Hi all,  I hope you had a great holiday break!  The grades for the progress report have been uploaded to Coursera. Per usual, please let us know if your grade is missing or if you think it should be changed.  Regarding some of the progress reports, many of the groups reported similar technical problems or barriers to progress. Thus, it's likely that other students have solved the problem that you're facing. **We highly recommend making public posts here on Campuswire if your group is facing any problems, so that other students can offer their insights and input.**  Best, Kevin 
THREAD: Need help optimizing topic mining result Hello,  I'm working on mining topics from the lecture videos. I started out implementing PLSA, but the result was terrible. After doing some research, I started to implement gensim. It was also bad at first, but after including bigrams and trigrams, the results improved a little bit. However, there are still many noises in the result. I wonder if anyone can point me some directions for further improvements.   Thank you!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I used sci-kit learn implementation and got decent results. You can compare NMF, TruncatedSVD and LDA fairly easily REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In the preprocessing stage, you can try filtering out noise words at the same time you filter out stopwords. You might have to do several iterations of this, but the proportion of noise should decrease. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I used TextRank with NLP with good results. I recommend this article. https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/text-summarization-using-textrank-in-nlp-4bce52c5b390 
THREAD: Can we leave special note to reviewers for final project? Hello,  Our project involves updating a database and a frontend component but we would like to avoid exposing our api-key to update the database publicly in case of malicious attempts. Is there a way we can leave notes for our reviewers with the necessary api-key to use if they need it to attempt and run the part of our code that updates our database?  Thanks in advance! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think you can put it in the readme on how to access the api-key. But work with the assumption that not everyone will run your code. People may want to see the results in your project report and evaluate the project without running it. And again you may have folks who would want to run it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The Project Abstract section in CMT (where you added the project repo link) is only accessible to your team, TAs and the reviewers. You can mention the API key in the Abstract section in CMT and this way reviewers will have direct access to the key without much hustle. Additionally, in the README file you can mention to grab the API key from the CMT Abstract section. We have a similar situation like this and we are taking this approach.    Make your code not to throw an exception if API key is not provided rather add few lines to let the user know API key is missing and how user can grab the API key and let user to provide that as an argument or config. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Excellent, thank you. I will add notes to the Abstract Section and refer to that in our Readme

THREAD: How to access inverted index? I'm confused as to how to access the inverted index generated from the function below in metapy. I'd just like to view it first before trying to manipulate it's contents.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1197666b-242c-4bd3-8b3a-9b7f0a5bbf93/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Last time when I got curious i got this url that gives some references of cpp file in the meta repo. (https://yeonghoey.com/python/metapy/index/)  On your project you will file a `idx` directory that contains all the index information.   Per the implementation seems those files are compressed  https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/src/index/inverted_index.cpp#L247  If you figure out the way how to analyze those file by either A. decompressing those file or B. accessing the idx object data structures, you might get a direction. You can reach out to TAs or in office hour and they might give you more context. 
THREAD: Background Language Model Implementation Anyone have any resources on implementation of a background language model in Python? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: NLTK has a stopword list: from nltk.corpus import stopwords REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used this to understand language modeling in python that uses NLTK.  https://medium.com/swlh/language-modelling-with-nltk-20eac7e70853  Might be a reference point for you to build your background language model:  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you use SKlean's vectorization method (either TfidfVectorizer, or its building block CountVectorizer) they take stop_words as a parameter. You can simply use a stopwords txt file, load it into a python list, and pass it into the constructor of either of these functions.

The former's extra credit hasn't shown up in the Grading panel in Coursera, and the latter is still in "Submitted" state. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: There were lots of previous conversation where student asked about extra credit of MP 2.4 but all of them were politely ignored and not answered ultimately. If we decide that we will not provide any extra credit anymore for some reason , I would expect this to be clarified as well .

THREAD: Final project documentation Hi Professor and TAs,  For the final project documentation, one of the required elements is apparently "An overview of the function of the code (i.e. what it does and what it can be used for).  I have developed several programs and scripts for my final project, and I have high level description for each in the documentation. That said, for "overview of functions", is the expectation to describe the most critical functions in the source code in the documentation? What granularity is appropriate? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I assume the high-level description for the functionality is enough. If you can explain what each function does and the input/output then it should be fine. Professor and TAs could give you a better answer on this REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: High-level description is enough such as what this script is doing and meanwhile mention some critical functions.

THREAD: Topics to be covered in Exam 2 Dear Students,   Hope you've been enjoying the Thanksgiving Break!   Here's the list of topics to be covered in Exam 2: [CS410-exam2-topics-fa21.pdf](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4e68215b-51fe-499d-bbd1-814cdc2e35c6/CS410-exam2-topics-fa21.pdf).   Exam 2 of CS410 covers the materials of Weeks 7-12. This list includes the specific topics to be covered in Exam 2 with a detailed explanation of what you are expected to know about each topic. As in the case of the list of topics for Exam 1, this list is also meant to provide you a chance to “double check” whether you have indeed mastered all the lectures covered in Exam 2. We stress the importance of watching and digesting every lecture, so, DO NOT review this topic list BEFORE you finish reviewing all the lecture videos or slides. Instead, the best way to use this list (which should also enable you to benefit most from this list) is to review this list AFTER you have finished reviewing all the lectures and quiz questions as a way to reinforce your understanding of the most important concepts and also check whether there might still be any hole in your understanding. If you have difficulty in understanding any concept/topic, go back to the corresponding lectures/slides, or post questions on Campuswire, or visit our office hours.   Enjoy the rest of the break and good luck on Exam 2!  Thanks, -Cheng

THREAD: Has anyone implemented Gensim LDA with Priors? Hi, I'm using the Gensim LDA tool to create a topic model.  Has anyone successfully built an LDA model using eta (beta) priors?    I have created a matrix (#n words) x (# topics) with pre-configured probabilities.  Big probabilities for the words that I want to seed the topic, small probabilities for the other words.   I normalized the probabilities for each word to sum to 1 across topics.   When I train the model, I set eta to this matrix.   After training, the topic word distributions are identical to the model trained with ete='auto'.  Any ideas?  Thanks, jh. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I have used the scikitlearn implementation for LDA. It works well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for the pointer.  This helped me to find some good options (e.g. NMF is giving me some very good results).  Also, I can see that choices made in pre-processing have a big effect on topic quality.     I'll haven't tried priors with scikit but will.   
THREAD: Topic Analysis probability For topic analysis, can someone help me understand what is the probability we are trying to maximize in the generative model? How does this relate to the topic distribution and topic coverage distribution?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/950781fc-204c-4211-b0fc-7d666e9bbf46/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Based on word distribution process, there are two things that need to be solved:  1. whether the word come from topic model $$p(z=0|w)$$  2. what is the probability of w in topic model $$p(w|theta_d)$$   From my understanding, EM algorithm helps maximize the probability of the "topic" words in above two things through iteration. We use background model and words count as the known information to start with. As we don't know the $$p(w|theta_d)$$, we can assume some random probabilities. (lecture used equal distribution for each word) - E-step uses background model to filter out most-likely topic words and weight them more $$p(z=0|w)$$.  - M-step re-estimates $$p(w|theta_d)$$ by using $$p(z=0|w)$$ from E-step.   So each step you can adjust the value of $$p(w|theta_d)$$ which is also a local maximum. $$p(z=0|w)$$ is a by-product that explains how well the topic model explained the document.   ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-23%20at%2010.11.38%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5bdae152-5e88-4cab-bb2f-11f3afc189cb/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-23%20at%2010.11.38%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: this is a helpful explanation

THREAD: How to manually create qrels.txt for query-document relevance? As part of our team project, we want to evaluate a set of queries on a defined document set (index) similar to in MP2. In order to do this, it seems we need to create a txt file in the same format as [cranfield-qrels.txt](https://github.com/dheerajpatta/MP2.4_private/blob/master/cranfield-qrels.txt) in MP2.4, where the first column is the query id, second is doc id, and third is relevance level.   However, we're not sure how to match each document to a doc id. In MP2 the index is created from cranfield.dat, but how is each document mapped to a doc id? Is each period-separated phrase in cranfield.dat a distinct document? Essentially, how can we get a document given its doc id, so that we can evaluate its relevance score and populate the qrels.txt file properly? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Assuming a line corpus like in MP2, then the **doc id is the line # in the .dat file. The first line corresponds to doc id = 0.**  What might be helpful is to search for a single query, then print out its top results (showing both the doc_id and its contents). From there, it is easy to fill out your own queries.txt and qrels.txt file. Then repeat for the remaining queries you want in your evaluation.  Reading through https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/tutorials/2-search-and-ir-eval.ipynb is extremely helpful. Note in input [9], you can modify it so it prints out the d_id too. Also note that in order to access content from metadata as in Input [9], you need to add `store-full-text = true` to `line.toml`. I believe this function is limited to converting UTF-8 encoding though, so you might need to create your own function if your documents contain special characters not in UTF-8. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! This link is to the tutorial is quite helpful. Although for some reason  ``` idx.metadata(docid).get('content') ```  always returns none for me, even though I added store-full-text = true to line.toml. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: **Try deleting the /idx/ folder so that MetaPy creates a new one.** If an /idx/ folder already exists, MetaPy just loads it instead of creating a new one. So if you created an index earlier with a smaller corpus (say for testing purposes), then it might not be able to find the docid in your new, larger corpus because the index is outdated.  Check the size of idx/inv/metadata.db (or metadata.index, I forgot which one). It should be more than 1 KB, otherwise it's probably not storing any metadata. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That was the problem, after deleting the idx directory and recreating the index I can get the content now. Thanks! 
THREAD: Questions on final project submission Hi Professor and TA,  For the final project's documentation and presentation submission (due Dec 9),  1\. When will the instructions be available?  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-19%20at%208.35.52%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e02f1d8f-ad18-4d6d-82ba-1dfee97a4e3f/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-19%20at%208.35.52%20PM.png)2. For the documentation, is it sufficient to simply put the documentation in the README in the git repo? Or do you expect us to put the documentation into separate pdf document in the git repo?  3\. To run my project, it requires credentials for some of the cloud services I used. How should I share that with TAs and the peer reviewers? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I've just made it available, but the instructions here are minimal. Please refer to [Week 1 Course Project Overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview) for more detailed project submission information. 2. Yes, the documentation can be in the README, as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it.  3. If possible, you could set up a simple public-facing server where users can interact with your system. But if this is not possible, then providing the source code + a detailed software usage presentation video should be alright.   Best, Kevin REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For (3), it looks like part of the grading will be based on whether the reviewers will be able to run or interact with the system successfully. Without the credentials, the reviewers won't be able to try out my code. Will my project's grade get penalized for that? 
THREAD: Reminder to update reviews :)  Hi everyone,  This message serves as a reminder to update your assigned reviews to answer the questions marked [PROGRESS]. This task is technically due today (Nov 19th).   You'll be able to see your own updated reviews by Sunday. Grades for the progress report will be added to Coursera sometime early next Week. I'll send another update about this.   Regarding the project, the next few deadlines to worry about are the final submission (Dec 9th) and the final reviews (Dec 9th - 17th).

The fees depend on the time of exams, for CS410, each exam costs $16. One of my other courses cost $22 for each exam causes it takes 2 hours to finish the exam. For on-campus students, I think the ProctorU fees are already covered by their tuitions.

Otherwise, if you add the exam yourself it costs $16. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Maybe you are in the wrong section. Choose the one for on-campus students.

THREAD: EM Algorithm with conjugate prior In Lecture 9.9 slide 6, how many prior word distributions are there? I assume there's **ONLY ONE prior** **p(w|theta'_j)**, which is used for smoothing the word distribution p(w|theta) for **ALL the topics** to reflect prior preferences. Please share some insights if this understanding is not quite right.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ad6ddb70-6395-4de7-b072-edaa9c32f807/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hmm... No response so far, does it mean that there's no other different interpretations of this algorithm? :)   It would be great if TAs or professor can confirm if this understanding is correct. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe you're right. There's only one prior on this example.  However, I don't think this prior is used for smoothing all the topics to reflect prior preferences. I believe in this case it is only used to smooth theta_j. The smoothing pseudo counts added when calculating p(w|theta_j) is essentially saying that, regardless of what is seen in the data in regards to theta_j, we already know/assume that "battery" and "life" are words that should have a strong probability (how much of the prior you want to add into the probability estimations is contolled by mu). However, for other topics tetha_j+1, tetha_j+2, etc...  we might not have any prior knowledge so we wouldn't add any other smoothing terms in the probability formula.   E.g. we might know for sure that we're looking at data that has do to with batter life (so you add your prior knowledge on that topic specifically), but perhaps we don't know if this data was gathered for mobile devices, home appliances, laptop computers, for reviews of only some countries or regions, etc, etc, which could be some of the other topics covered in your collection. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for sharing! After implementing the algorithm, I also came to realize that the prior should be used on only one topic, because otherwise all topics would be forced to cover similar topics, which doesn't make much sense.

THREAD: Dataset for Final Project I am using web scrapping to generate my dataset. I was wondering if I can just do this once, so that I don't have to repeat this process over and over again, since it takes a very long time. I plan on implementing sentiment analysis on this dataset. The only downside of this would be that I wouldn't have "real-time" or "close to real-time" data when implementing sentiment analysis.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I do not see any problem on this approach as long as your dataset is big enough to perform sentiment analysis but check with TA and mention this in your progress report  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is the dataset changing frequently? Is it possible to cache existing scrapes and only request the changes? Don't have context about your dataset, but I'm choosing to cache on my side and only look for new data. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Datasets like faculty  doesn't change much over the period of time...  Datasets like old news or an old event also wont  change over the period of time...  But datasets like daily news or daily tweets will change every day..   So the sentiment analysis is done on which datasets is the major factor that you take as a decision point.  You can definitely use the dataset that you scraped... But if you are planning doing the analysis on a changing dataset, things you can improve is by thinking how can you constantly update your dataset as parallel system so your indexed data is always current...   You can scope out your work but try achieving small steps at a time and take the agile approach.. See if you can implement sentiment analysis first on the scraped dataset and then see how can you improve the overall system once you have build confidence implementing the whole system with the vanilla flavor.  Also, You can always call out areas of improvement on your project so someone if interested can build on top of that (like  many teams are improving the ExpertSearch system as part of their project). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would suggest  scrape once - mention the date of scrapping in your report if necessary submit your data along with your report.  It is very difficult to be up to date with the dataset.   The project evaluation will not happen at the same time that you will scrape your dataset. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try to analyze how often your dataset is updated by scrapping in two different dates. After that present your results in your report and make the right assumptions for the project. I had the same issue as well, but fortunately I can quickly check the date of last update and do some type of transactional update in the dataset. 
THREAD: Grades for proposal + progress report due  Hi everyone,  Sorry for the delay, but the grades for the proposal have been uploaded to Coursera. Please check your grade and let us know if you think that we made a mistake.   The progress report is due Nov 15th at midnight CT. After the deadline, you should go and update your submitted reviews to include the answers to the progress report questions. This should be completed by Nov 19th at midnight CT. Around then, the updated reviews will be made available to the groups.  Best, Kevin   
THREAD: Project Progress submission  Project Progress report has to be a separate document ? Are there any specific items expected other than  1) Which tasks have been completed?  2) Which tasks are pending?  3) Are you facing any challenges?  4) Plus anything specifically mentioned in the reviews to cover.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Yes, Progress report is a separate document. I think what you  have listed should cover all main questions to be answered in the progress report. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I copied over the table we created for the project proposal and gave feedback on each line item about the progress we made 
THREAD: Exam 1 score not shown in Coursera I could not see my Exam 1 score in Coursera even though I have completed it and seen the score right after submitting it in ProctorU. Is that normal?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I can see mine. The only thing I can't see is "Project Proposal and Team Formation Submission for..." which hasn't been graded yet, I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I can see mine. You could verify your ProctorU account is linked to your UIUC ID, but I'm not sure that's necessary to get the grade synced.

Mine is the same way. 
THREAD: Progress Report  Template Hi, is there  template that we can use for writing the progress report for the course project? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think you have to write about progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. The grading is based only on completion not on what you have mentioned. Therefore, you can use your judgement what to include. Please see below information from coursera  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1b8f4e0b-4133-4a9b-80ba-943afdd1cae4/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As we are peer-review for grading. I believe if you show enough effort and answer the question it will always be fine. A bullet-list for tasks and paragraph for challenge should be good enough.

I checked the "my sessions" tab as well as my cart and can confirm I have not been able to book the session yet. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This happened to me as well. You can talk to someone at ProctorU via chat and let them know which exam/time slot you want, and they can schedule it for you.

I haven't tried booking exam 2 yet, but **I was able to book exam 1 by following the link given in an email that you should have received regarding exam 2**. Look up the subject "Reservation invitation reminder" from noreply@protoru.com REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: This is known issue while scheduling the exam. Many students faced  this for Exam1 too.  You have couple of options (both were discussed on the other two replies): 1. You might have received a email on your illinois mailbox. with subject line `Reservation invitation reminder`. You can follow the invitation link and schedule the exam2 at proctoru website. 2. You can also always call/chat proctorU helpline and have them scheduled for you.

THREAD: Progress Report Submission Hi! Where and how can we submit our project progress reports? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The section for project progress submission seems still locked (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/pReV0/project-progress-report-submission-for-grading). So TAs might unlock it soon with further instructions added and/or possibly they will make an announcement here as well as the date approaches.   https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/GKzxo/course-project-overview contains some information what need to included part of project progress report but doesn't mention anything about submission in there.  I believe we have to upload another document (Project Progress document) on our same Course Project Repository of Github (maybe some work in progress code too) but will wait for Instructors/TAs to confirm.

THREAD: Week 11 Practical Quiz 10 Hi, I have trouble with this question. I guess I misunderstood the concept of KNN. If k = 1, I circled the nearest neighbors:  ![1636287101%281%29.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/28aae477-db78-4fa8-84e6-7394ca0ad3cb/1636287101%281%29.jpg)  Hence, there are three '1' labels and three '0' labels. I know it is probably wrong but don't know how to imply KNN.  Could anyone give me some hints or explanation on it? Many thanks in advance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to find the k documents that are more similar to D6, (for question 10 k=1), then use the label of that document for D6. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since the similarity score of 0.85 is the highest in the D6 line, D6 is similar to D1 (?). So, we assign D1's class to D6 => label=1 for D6 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As $$k=1$$, you need to fine the one document that is nearest to D6. In the table of D6 column, D1 has the largest number 0.85 so it is the one that is closest to D6. So D6 should assign the same label as D1 which is 1. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-07%20at%208.47.34%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2729c349-5139-4a00-b24b-2c22faf04a0f/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-07%20at%208.47.34%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The idea behind KNN is to make groups based on similarities between nodes. But the question then is: How many nodes would you consider (as neighbours)? You can't assume the whole data set as being similar, otherwise you are just making a big single group, which would be rather meaningless. The k value tells you the number of nodes you should consider as neighbours. If k = 1 you are looking for just one node closest to you - closest means most similar. The question actually simplifies the "similarity logic" by providing a score between two nodes indicating how similar they are. So for D6, you just pick up the highest score (thus highest similarity) for k=1. D1 is that node (you look at the column/row title, and the score is similarity between the column/row titled node). now, you just look at the label D1 has - since D6 would belong to the same group.  In another question you would find a different value of k. there you are looking for different number of neighbours and trying to look at their labels, and that complicates the question a little bit. In general k=1 would be the easiest as having a single feature/label would not have ambiguity. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The nearest neighbor will have the highest similarity with D6 (i.e., D1).

Wouldn't #2 be very difficult, because I am not sure If I am qualified/ have the knowledge to judge an industry leader's work?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think that instead of objectively judging the techniques/approaches discussed, you could include your thoughts on the approach and what you think of it in relation to your own project plan. Like will you consider using the described approach (why or why not)?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You only need to tell a story. If it is complete, it is fine.  I introduced a python package, which is useful to text processing.  You may read a paper, and try to show the main messages.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/NROf1/technology-review-submission  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can also browse through multiple tech review submissions (on the sign up sheet) and see how classmates presented the tech review and you might get some reference too.  Once you are decided on the technology to review, you are not required to "judge" but you can always share your thoughts in and around the technology. You can share your observations, what you have learnt from the technology, what are the benefits of its, where it can be most contributing, anything you were not able to understand etc. This is more like your take on that technology and putting that in a tech review paper. Good Luck.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I felt the same, but what helped was i looked at related work section in the paper and the reference papers and saw how other studies approached the problem. then i discussed their pros and cons based on the limitations that they say in their papers. i don't think you *have* to judge its efficacy and use - studies are continuously working to improve existing work. just try to compare to other similar work and see how one system may be better/different! 
THREAD: How do I check if I am taking this course for 4 or 3 credits? Sorry if this is a dumb question but just want to double check. I’m taking this as part of the MSCS-DS track so I assume it is 4 credits REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you go on self service and view your schedule for this semester (on the course registration website), it'll tell you the number of credit hours!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Login to [UIUC Self Service](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/) Navigate to Registration & Records and under Classic or Enhanced Registration or even under View Academic History. You can check whether you have 3 credits or 4 credits. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it's automatically 4 credits for us MCS-DS students. I just checked (it's 4 for me) and I dont remember looking at or thinking about number of credits at all when registering REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you are taking a online master degree, probably it is 4 credits. (this is for my case) If you are taking a campus class for a bachelor degree, probably it is 3 credits.  After all, you should know your program REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can check via Self Service but I believe it's 4 credits for all graduate students 
THREAD: Required Questions for Progress Report Does anybody know what the required questions to answer are for the progress report? I don't recall seeing those anywhere. TIA REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview it states:  "Progress report (5%): Each project team is required to submit a short progress report by the beginning of Week 13 (Nov 15, 2021) listing the progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. It will be graded based on completion. " From the above, I'm guessing that the questions to be answered are:  1. What progress was made 2. What tasks remain 3. What challenges/issues were faced

THREAD: Project review question As part of the Project Review exercise , we have been assigned a few projects . Do we expect to provide the comment on **the same project **during PROGRESS and FINAL phase or we will be assigned a different project ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we will be assigned the same project for the later phases as well.  Leaving it unresolved so that the TAs can add their comments if otherwise.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I suspect (prefer?) that it'll be randomly assigned for the next rounds so the number of projects reviewed by each of us evens out (i.e., those who reviewed 3 now will hopefully get 1 project to review in the next round and vice versa) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you will be assigned the same projects. For future deadlines, all you will have to do is update your answers to the reviews.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks !! ... It makes sense as it takes time to review each project properly and a few projects assigned to me are quite interesting and hoping to learn from them as well. Different random set of project does defeat the purpose here, thanks again  
THREAD: exam 2 questions I have been seeing practice quiz contains questions from Optional content ( specially in week 11 ) , can we expect that our exam 2 questions might also come from optional contents ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: TA and Instructors will be able to confirm this but so far in this program i haven't seen questions from optional part are being asked in Exams.  One possibility is few lecture videos might have been recently marked as optional as they review the course structure every year and at times make minor adjustments. And while marking a video lecture as optional they might have forgot to remove the corresponding question from quiz.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: as one of the TAs had mentioned for the last exam that there will be no material in exam1 or the quiz from optional material. so I'm under the impression that this will be the same for exam2 as well. but it would be better if the TAs can comment on this.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The professor mentioned in one of his office hours that optional materials won't be included in the exams. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I hope that comment is not made for exam 1

THREAD: Question for Week11 Practice Q5 For the Week 11 Practice Q5, we were asked to calculate P(Spam) using Maximum Likelihood and it only used $$count(Spam, doc)/count(docs)$$.   However, in previous learning, we usually use word counts for Maximum Likelihood which will be $$wordcount(Spam)/wordcount(all)$$=4/10.   Can someone explain when we should use wordcount and when use documentcount for Maximum Likelihood calculation (without smoothing)?  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-05%20at%207.40.11%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e8e22f08-f79f-4638-b9bb-3cae8a5561a8/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-05%20at%207.40.11%20AM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I chose 1/3 since there are three data points (d1, d2, and d3) and only one of them (d1) is spam. Perhaps this is just coincidental but there are 12 (non-unique) words in all and 4 of them correspond to spam.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did the same and no option for 2/5. But a little confused why use document count not word count here.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What I understood is that the question is related to the prior probability, so we just to normalize the document count for the spam category.

The original category 2 is 6 terms in length. With laplace smoothing, it grows to 10 terms in length (add 1 term for each 4 topics in the domain) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In Practice Quiz 11 Q8, we already have$$P(theta1/d3)=3/7$$. So $$P(theta2/d3)=4/7$$. As it has higher probability for $$P(theta2/d3)$$, d3 belongs to $$theta 2$$ which is category2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: P(θ1|d3) = p(d3|θ1) / ( p(d3|θ1)+ p(d3|θ2) ) = (1/10 * 3/ 10) / ( (1/10 * 3/ 10) + (2/10 * 2/ 10) ) = 3/7   P(θ2|d3) = p(d3|θ2) / ( p(d3|θ1)+ p(d3|θ2) ) = (2/10 * 2/ 10) / ( (1/10 * 3/ 10) + (2/10 * 2/ 10) ) = 4/7  We select the higher of the two, which corresponds to category 2.

I can't follow it even from the lecture without a clear example REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = count of y(+)/(count of y(+) + count of y(-))  = 7/(7+1)  = 7/8  Recall = TP/(TP+FN) = count of y(+)/ (count of y(+) + count of n(+)) = 7/(7+1) = 7/8  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Consider the entire matrix for the calculation here  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: For micro - averaging, you look at all the values from all categories & docs to calculate P & R. This contrasts with macro - averaging, where you would aggregate over either all of the docs or all of the categories (but not both). The formulas for P & R are the same, but for micro - averaging, you look at all the values in the table 
THREAD: Metapy returns None when trying to get the content of document in the index I am looking into MP2.4 again and am trying to modify the code a bit to get the content of the document that occurred in the top k results. For this, I am following the tutorials given here: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/tutorials/2-search-and-ir-eval.ipynb and have added this block of code:  ``` results = ranker.score(idx, query, top_k)  for num, (d_id, _) in enumerate(results):   print(idx.metadata(d_id).get('content'))   ```  This idx.metadata(d_id).get('content') part always seems to return None when I try to fetch it for any document id. Did anyone else face the same issue?  Basically, what I intend to do here is to get the content of the top k documents returned for the given query. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You need to add store-full-text = true in the line.toml file. Then delete the current idx folder and rerun your code.

THREAD: Reminder to review :) Hello!  This message serves as a final reminder to 1. Please accept the CMT review invitation email if you haven't yet (~100 students have not yet accepted).  2. Once accepted, please fill out the reviews that have been assigned to you in the "Reviewer" console on CMT by this Sunday.   The second step should take no more than ~10 minutes per review, and I'm sure groups would really appreciate your feedback. We have about 50 papers right now with no reviews submitted, and it would be a shame if come Sunday this was still the case. So please do your part!   As a timeline, you can expect to see the reviews for your submission by the end of this weekend. TAs will also be going through the submissions, giving brief meta review feedback, and updating Coursera grades, which will hopefully also be completed by the end of this weekend.  And thank you for your patience through all of this.   Best, Kevin 
THREAD: Tech Review github link and references While signing up for the tech review I left the github link and references section blank/TBD.

TAs please confirm if this is needed or we can add just add the github and references info to our paper instead? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As post #1330, TA confirmed that we can change tech review and reminded us submit it before deadline. I think it should be fine to change your reference link in the sign-up sheet as you are graded by your submission not sign-up sheet. Sign-up sheet is used for later TA or classmates review as our tech review is saved in the public repo.

Naive Bayes Classifier is considered generative, and yet its general form, Logistic Regression, is considered discriminative. How can this be? I'd expect them to both be of the same class.    ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/93e0c29c-aed2-4c25-8d0e-8abd1ab073f5/image.png)  Also, in Week 10, discriminative classifiers are described as learning what features separate categories. How does Logistic Regression accomplish this? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the difference between discriminative classifiers and generative classifiers is that discriminative classifiers try to model p(Y|X) directly while generative classifiers try to model  p(Y, X) first. 
THREAD: tech review paper - figures Is it acceptable to have figures for example of model architectures in the review paper? (i'm guessing just the text should be 2 pg long, and figures should take up extra pages)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe so. As long as you show enough effort and do not use the figure simply to make up word count it should be fine. See #1545  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As per https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages " No mention of figures, unless these are part of the storyline? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As mentioned in #1545, architectures/images/diagrams/codes can be put in tech review paper but if they take significant portion of the paper then the paper might be needed to extend beyond 2 pages. No official limit in no. of pages. The actual review content (the textual content) is expected to be around ~2 pages.   Also make sure to add proper citations if the architectures/images/diagrams/codes are not completely yours.    
THREAD: Tech Review Spacing Is there a format we should be following? Font sizing ? Spacing (double, single , 1.5) ?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As per https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages "   There is no formatting instructions. So, it's most likely "free form" as long as the "coherent storyline", "cite relevant references", and "at least ~2 pages" are there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Specific format wasn't mentioned. The guidelines just says "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references."  So it might not need any specific templates but just a good flow of the sections along with references.  But for neat documentation and presentable format if you are looking for any standard templates, I think any of these standard templates can be used (nothing mandatory):  **IEEE Template** https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx  **SIGKDD Template** https://www.kdd.org/formats/template.doc 
THREAD: Can Tech review contain code snippets and Images ? I am working a tech review for enterprise wide usable toolkit (combination of few tools/frameworks).  Can the Tech review document contain code snippets and Images ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not aware of any scenario why the tech review can't have images or code snippets.   However, if the code snippets and images you referenced from somewhere else you would need to do the citation. But if they are yours then citations wont be needed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yeah, I am kind of creating them on my own... But wanted to confirm from TA or professor.. If its allowed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think it is okay to create image/code snip it, but it should not be included as your 2 pages count. So, i would adjust the number pages if you have a lot of image/code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, code snippets and images are fine. Like others have said, remember to cite and try not to have them take up significant portions of the two pages (it's ok to go over if needed).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is there a limit of 2 pages for the tech review? What is the maximum page limit? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't believe there is a specific page limit, but try to keep it around 2 pages of text plus any images or code that you include.  
THREAD: Practice Quiz 11: Question 6 I am struggling to put values into the formulas to figure out which document has the highest probability of spam. Especially since all documents have 2 words that belong to the spam labelled spam document.  Can someone help with an example please? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is how I answered this question. I may be wrong. Q5 has "d1" as the only one with Spam and has words:  Save Money No Fees  For Q6, the only option with just these four words or their subset is the first choice: "no fees" The other choices have "ham" words. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: There is a hint at the end of question6 to refer to lecture 11.1.  - $$P(Spam)/P(Ham)$$ is determined in question 5 and it is the same for all options.  - Word count is 1 for each term. So it is same as well for all. - $$P(w|Span)/P(w|Ham)$$ is the only one that affects the score. As "no fees" has no ham term, P(w|Ham) is 0 which means $$P(w|Span)/P(w|Ham)$$ is almost infinite. As all options have two Span terms, phase with only Span terms have two largest value which lead to the largest total score. All the others have larger denominators which means lower scores.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Doesn't matter which is nominator and which is denominator but score meaning flips.  - If the ratio $$p(w | spam)/p(w | ham)$$ is high, then the w is more likely from category spam - If the ratio flips as $$p(w | ham)/p(w | spam) $$, high ratio means w is more likely from category ham.

Progress report (5%): Each project team is required to submit a short progress report by the beginning of Week 13 (Nov 15, 2021) listing the progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. It will be graded based on completion.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: that's not my question. 
THREAD: Tech Review Content Can we relate the papers/approaches we're learning about to our final project in the tech review? For example, if the papers discuss different approaches, would it be ok for us to write about the pros/cons of the approaches and how they might work with our dataset? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I think that's okay to do. As long as your review has a flow Intro, body, conclusion and at least 2 pages. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe this is encouraged, as per this part of the tech review instructions:  "The deadline is set to an earlier time than that of course project code submission so as to give the students an opportunity to read some relevant reviews (especially those on toolkits) before finishing their projects if they want to. " 
THREAD: SVM, training error and nonlinear decision boundaries Lecture 11.2 talks about how to introduce training error to SVM when text categories aren't cleanly separable.  In practice, do people also use the kernel trick with SVM? That can model nonlinear decision boundaries. Are there best practices for choosing an approach or set of approaches? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I can't speak to best practices for choosing appropriate kernels (just cross-validation maybe?) but kernelized SVM is absolutely a thing, you can see `kernel` arguments in popular implementations [like sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)  there is also a way to modify the SVM objective function to allow for misclassifications. basically instead of a "hard" margin, you can have a "soft" margin that allow some points to be on the wrong side of the decision boundary, with a penalty increasing with the size of the distance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the reference. I'm curious about best practices for text categorization. For example, I can see kernel usage leading to overfitting the training data. If I have time I'll poke around some. 
THREAD: Logistic Regression Equation ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b898b09d-e673-4516-9f62-82c22580fe41/image.png)  I have seen Logistic Regression many times, but never expressed using this notation. My guess is that this is another representation of the sigmoid function, but for the life of me I cannot follow the notation.  Can anyone explain what this equation is doing in the most basic terms possible? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: you have probably seen this definition of the sigmoid: $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$   multiply by $$\frac{e^z}{e^z}$$: $$\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\frac{e^z}{e^z} = \frac{e^z}{e^z+e^ze^{-z}} = \frac{e^z}{e^z+1}$$  And they just substitute in $$z=\beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^Mx_i\beta_i$$ to get the form shown there. If the form of $$z$$ is confusing, it's just an expanded way of writing $$z = \beta^T X$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/eb01bda4-8651-4d51-bbeb-cd725da65d63/image.png)  So, what we have is $\sigma_t = p(Y=1|X)$ , which has a range from 0 to 1. For the right hand side, we have $t$ equal the exponent ($\Beta_o +...$   
THREAD: Cannot Find Proposal Review on Github I was assigned one proposal review. After I followed the link in abstract to Github, the only file I found was a README.md that was updated 13 months ago. The README file is not relevant to the project proposal. There was no other branch, nothing in the Pull Request or Wiki section either. What should I do in this case?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same here :D  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe that is your review comment to the first project proposal question that it is not available for you to review so it is sent back to author to resubmit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same here as well. But I could download the proposal by clicking "Download." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you are not able to find any file (pdf or doc or docx) as part of the project proposal in the git repository, then I would also send a private post to the Instructors and see what their advice is.  Maybe the team did an attachment on the CMT itself or might have just missed uploading to git. Instructors would be able to best advice on next steps if a proposal document is missing from the git repo to review.   For example. for one of my review assignment came as attached document available to download from CMT, like this ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e89775c9-d04b-43c0-8be4-b0e3f17d34b3/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did not see the Download button on the CMT itself either. I did an exhaustive search but nothing turned up, so I submitted the review saying I couldn't find the proposal.

THREAD: Confirming Tech Review submitted My livedatalab leaderboard says my score is 1 for the tech review, however the Coursera grades section indicates no submission.  Anyone else have this issue?  Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have the same thing as well and I posted a message earlier but it is yet to be resolved. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok this happens if you make your repo private.  Make sure it's public. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Make sure you open the tool inside Coursera when submitting. It should be on the tech review submission page inside Coursera.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Not sure if you already tried this one but with the nature of the issue you mentioned, this is one of the most common reason why this happens.  When login in livelabdata did you open  livelabdata using the "Open Tool" option on Tech Review Submission Page on Coursera. This mainly happens due to livelabdata not loged in using the "Open Tool" Button.  If not (or not sure) then logout and login in livelabdata using the "Open Tool" button and re-push the tech review from git hub generally works.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1c68d640-e82e-4630-9cd4-a6592deb7261/image.png)   
THREAD: Leaderboard Shows 0 Could there be any reason why MP3 leaderboard shows 0 but the grader output shows success? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Leaderboard score is 1 when success (atleast what I have seen happened to me so far).  See if your MP3 Coursera grades are updated too.   If you have got your MP3 Coursera grade too then I would just notify TA/Instructors letting them know about the observation.   If your  your MP3 Coursera grade is not yet updated, then also I would get in touch with instructors either in a private post or in office hours to have them a look into your solution and help you find the root cause.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe success only means that your code is able to execute without any issues. so when you get a 0 on the leaderboard, it probably means that your code does not meet the grading criteria and did not pass any test cases due to which it gives you a 0 irrespective of the fact of the grader output of success.  It would be best if you get it to clarify with the TAs. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Grader Success means your code compiled successfully. Leaderboard 0: Your code did not pass test sets - No points awarded Leaderboard 1: Your code passed test sets - 100% points awarded. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For MP3, did anyone else face this too? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I had this issue in MP3 initially. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had this issue as well. It appears that getting the "success" output merely means the code was able to compile, but you won't get a 1 on the Leaderboard unless your code passes the tests and satisfies the instructions correctly. 
THREAD: Current grade in class Is there a way to check our current grade in class? As far as I know courser doesn't have a grades tab REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There is a "Grades" tab on the left panel after "Overview"  Depending on what we have done so far, we'll have to calculate it ourselves, I think.

However, on your Coursera grades section you will be able to see a snapshot of your itemized grades you achieved so far (quiz, MP, tech review, Exam etc).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cb451fa1-c6c0-4542-a043-1ffff257e78e/image.png)  In Slack or in Campuswirse there were voting done for Mid term Exam scores where you can see the data about students scores voted anonymously.    Final grade is something that is done at the end of the course and  would depend on multiple factors (and might also include curving depending on the instructor). I never heard of them doing any current grades so I wouldn't expect that.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Use this calculator (coursera grades hypothetical) 1. Quiz: Your grade (e.g. 90% on coursera) * 25 = 22.5 (hypothetical) 2. MP: Your grade (e.g. 100% on Coursera) * 25 = 25 (hypothetical) 3. Exam 1: Your Grade (e.g. 80% on Coursera) * 15 = 12 (hypothetical)  Add 1 + 2 + 3 = (22.5 + 25 + 12) = 59.5   Grades for  4. Exam 2:  Grade you will get * 15  5. Project: Grade you will get * 20 (if you submit everything as per deadlines you will surely get 18 (90%))  Add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 = say 92 -> corresponds to A   There is an extra credit of up to 5 points for contributing to Campuswire.

For example overview and steps involved in the raking systems. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Best would be take advice from instructors.  But what I understood is those links/papers are for your references only. You can search more stuff on internet, cite them as references and then put all your review thoughts on that technology on your technology review paper. More research you will do deeper understanding you will have on the technology to review. It is mainly how you are reviewing a technology which is related to the course but might not have been taught in the course. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you.

Just summarize the paper you read, and talk about how such technology can be applied to text information systems. You should have your own perspective in your work. 2. No. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You are expected to review papers related to this course, following the topic you wrote in the signup sheet.

THREAD: Normalization in Expectation Step I realize this assignment was due awhile ago, but I want to ask anyway:  For the E-Step in MP3, I understand what is happening (I think). What I'm trying to wrap my head around is the normalization aspect.  We know that documents are comprised of some proportion of topics.  We know that these topics are comprised of some proportion of words, each with their own probability of occurring.  A document should in theory have a sum of topic probabilities which sum to 1.  A topic in theory should have a sum of word probabilities which sum to 1 as well then.  **Thus, in self.topic_prob, each vocabulary within a topic should sum to 1, but then each topic within a document should also sum to 1?**  If this is correct, I can't wrap my head around how that would be possible. If each word probability in a topic sums to 1, then in a hypothetical situation where you have 2 topics, the sum of topic probabilities will sum to 2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: These are two different sets - the set of "vocabulary within a topic" and the set of "topic within a document". So, after normalization, everything within a topic sums to one and everything within a document sums to one.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: im sorry for not understanding but, let's say:  document A is comprised of topic 1 and topic 2 topic 1 has 2 words, both with .5 probability  topic 2 has 2 words, both with .5 probability  each word in topic 1 and in topic 2 will sum to 1 ("vocabulary within a topic")  Then, how can each "topic within a document" sum to 1? If each word within a topic sums to 1, and you have k topics, then each topic within a document will sum to k  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Consider a set of cars = {c1, c2, c3}. Assume that each element occurs with equal probability. I.e., p(c1)=p(c2)=p(c3)=1/3 So, for set of cars, p(c1)+p(c2)+p(c3)=1  Now consider another set with cars (c1, c2, c3) and trucks (t1, t2). So, we have a set of vehicles{c1, c2, c3, t1, t2}, each with equal (need not be, but for illustrative purposes) probability. I.e., in this set (of vehicles), p(c1)=p(c2)=p(c3)=p(t1)=p(t2)=1/5.  So, we can say, for the vehicle set, p(cars) + p(trucks) = 1.

THREAD: practice quiz 11: Assume the same setup as in Question 10. If k = 2, then the prediction would be: since k = 2, shouldn't we consider distance too? so d1 is closer and thus has more influence? 0.85 v.s 0.7  I can understand why it could be a tie. but that was my initially thought REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The answer to Q4: "k-NN only computes for each data which one is its nearest neighbor and there is no weights to estimate."  I.e., no higher (lower) weight for a data point that is closer (farther) to signify influence.  Slide 6 in 11-1 recording states, "Can be improved by considering the distance of a neighbor (a closer neighbor has more influence" I guess this "improvement" is not a part of the core KNN REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i see thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Right, for k-NN you do not appear to take distance into account when determining nearest neighbor weighting.

THREAD: A question about a regular expression I am a new coder. I'd like to double-check whether my understanding is correct on a regular expression.  ``` r'^[AEIOUaeiou]+|[AEIOUaeiou]+$|[^AEIOUaeiou]' ```  It includes three parts:   1. ```^[AEIOUaeiou]+ ``` :  the character start with ```[AEIOUaeiou]``` more than one times.  1. ```|[AEIOUaeiou]+$```: OR the character ends with ```[AEIOUaeiou]``` more than one times.  1. ```|[^AEIOUaeiou]```: OR the character doesn't in the range of ```[AEIOUaeiou]```    If there were any mistakes, please correct me.  Thanks in advance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think your suspicions about the first two are correct.   For the third one a range usually includes a hyphen.

THREAD: def expectation_step should *def expectation_step(self):* actually have two arguments, such as *def expectation_step(self, number_of_topics)* like in def maximization_step(self, number_of_topics): REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No not really. it updates/uses the information from the object variables (number of documents) and arrays (document topic prob and topic word prob), so you dont have to pass anything. Somebody has pointed out (not sure which thread) that even M step might not necessarily need the number of topics parameter.

THREAD: Tech Review Submission Do we only need to submit the `techreview.pdf ` in the git repo? Do we need anything else?

Here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  , it states:  "Review submission: Each student is required to submit a complete Technology Review by the end of Week 11 (Nov 7, 2021).  The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages " REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, only the pdf document needs to be submitted via Github. and i think we need to update the spreadsheet as well with the git repo link.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Yes you need to fork the tech review branch to your repo and upload the document named "techreview.pdf" to GitHub and then go to Leader Board and submit just like you do for MP assignments. Once you do that, you can take the PDF URL and update the sign up sheet. Once you submit the tech review in Leader Board, your Coursera will show the score as 1 (Although TAs will still review it later).

THREAD: Description Overlap There are a number of students sharing a topic, which is fine. But I noticed there is also a good amount of overlap in the descriptions/focus of the tech reviews for those topics. Is it simply suggested to have a novel take or required that everyone's description be different? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It does not matter. Just focus on what you want:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It states here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/aiRZI/technology-review-information   "your review must have novel content that does not exist in any existing literature or webpages so that it would offer unique information/knowledge that others can learn from your review. So please make sure to check whether there is already a review on the topic before you devote time to complete a review. If you find an existing review on the topic, you may still write about the topic, but just need to make sure that you take a somewhat different perspective than the existing review or add new content on top of the existing review (i.e., extending it in some way)." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm aware, but this does not seem to be enforced. If you look at the sign up doc, there is a ton of overlapping topics and descriptions. There should've been some "approval" or "lock in" phase to kind of guarantee no overlap. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the overlap here refers to "existing literature or web pages" and not among the descriptions we write REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: At least you should have something new, no matter topics/descriptions or perspectives.

THREAD: Do E or M step need to have for loops? I have seen in multiple campus wire posts that you should use einsum for the E and M step?  In the case that you use that, there is no need for for loops correct? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah you are correct. I ended up using for loops with a combination of numpy while writing my code at first. I find it easier to debug and understand with loops, then once you get a handle on the matrix operations and how all the matrices need to interact, modify the code and sub-in the needed numpy functions and parameters (like einsum). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i used both! 1. einsum to get the overall dimensions for E and M step. 2. for-loops for the normalization part. you could just forego for-loops, but doing a for-loop for normalization gave me good sanity check that i was doing the normalization correctly. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Human mind can hold 2D matrix multiplications - 3D is a stretch :-) Between easy but a bit longer; and complicated and shorter - I would suggest go with longer (loops) unless the easier version is very performance heavy- especially when the concept is new to you. what you lose in line brevity would be gained multiples times in clarity. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Completely Agree with Alok, spend a lot of time on 3D matrix multiplication and after cracking it I thought its much easier to do 2D multiplication with a simple for loop for one dimension ...   
THREAD: clarification regarding likelihood what is the shape of the calculate likelihood? should it be one singular value or a list of values?  when you append to self.likelihoods, are you appending one value each time or are you appending a list of values? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: self.likelihood should be an array of length (# of docs), representing the calculated value for all docs for the current iteration.  The array can be summed up for comparison between the current and previous iteration REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I have made self.likelihoods as a list of log-likelihood values from each iteration, this value should be increasing and should be converging.  2 consecutive iteration value can be compared to check if the difference is less than epsilon and if so can be considered as the converge point and stop further iteration.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: One value at a time representing combined likelihood of all the docs. So one iteration one element added to the list. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: likelihood should end up being a list of values (one value for each doc). might be easier to append just a list, instead of one value at a time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont think that is correct. Isnt likelihood defined across all the docs, instead of one value for each doc? that is where convergence is measured to compare successive iterations.

That is I didn’t push the code through git till I saw the convergence for the sample file REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: print the log likelihood here , this should increase until it reaches local maxima. If you find this converging on sample data , it should work on the big data set ...

Can't really conceptually understand what part of my algorithm being wrong would cause this. Has anyone else had this situation? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If this is for the test.txt file, your values are off ( should expect in the range of -17000s and then converge to -15000s). But then again can't really help without seeing how your E-step and M-Step are working! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've been staring at my E and M steps for awhile now so I was confident they were right but I'm calculating my topic_prob matrix via einsum with ```self.topic_prob = np.einsum("ij,jk->ijk", D, T)``` where D and T are doc_topic_probs and topic_word_probs. I've checked that the shape of topic prob is 1000,2,6 and then normalized every 2x6 matrix within. At this point I don't know what I couldve missed... My M step is pretty similar in that I use einsum but with term doc matrix and topic prob. All the resulting shapes match and I normalized after both einsums too. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you normalizing in E-step and M-step? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yup, normalized all 1000 2x6 matrices in E-step and topic_word_prob and document_topic_prob in M step REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: maybe be likelihood function? How are you doing that one? ( sorry there is only so much I can help with without looking at what you have!) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For that one I'm using matrix multiplication instead of for loops because that just seemed easier especially with the shapes.   I'm matrix multiplying document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob, then summing that result along axis=0, taking the log of that sum, and multiplying it by term_doc_matrix. Finally, I'm appending np.sum(likelihood) into corpus.likelihoods.  like so ``` likelihood = self.term_doc_matrix * np.log((np.sum(np.matmul(self.document_topic_prob,self.topic_word_prob), axis=0))) ```  I can't really grasp my head around how to do it with for loops so this is how i did it  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Look at post #1356, in there, at the bottom Amanda posted a screenshot of the equation hope that helps! ( no need for for loops for that one) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2bb65bca-463c-4017-bb1f-2de0de3b61be/image.png)  I am having the same problem like you, just the likelihood function, I think it has something to do with 2 summations over here. But I cant wrap my head around it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've summed across axis=1 to sum each word in V, then summed across axis=0 for each document in C so I really don't know what I'm missing from that formula tbh REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For E-step but I think you should be normalizing topic_word_prob as 2 1000x6 matrices instead of 1000 2x6 matrices.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you clarify more? I don't really understand how I could do that if the structure of topic_word_prob when printed is 1000 2x6 matrices. How would I transform 1000 2x6 into 2 1000x6 matrices freely like that  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So the shape of topic_word_prob is given as 1000x2x6 Each topic can be treated as a 1000x1x6 matrix.  To normalize we divide topic_word_prob by the sum of the topic matrixs.  What I had done to achieve that was sum topic_word_prob across axis = 1  Then divide topic_word_prob with the resulting matrix. ``` topic_word_prob / topic_word_prob.sum(axis = 1, keepdims = True) ```   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the problem is that you are multiplying a 1000by2 matrix (document_topic_prob) and a 2by6 matrix (topic_word_prob), which will result in a 1000by6 matrix. Using `np.sum(..., axis = 0)` on that matrix will sum all columns of the matrix, and result in  a 1by6 matrix.   To fix this issue, use `np.out()` to multiply doc/word on corresponding topic, and then sum them together. This way you will have a 1000by6 matrix.  
THREAD: Expected Log Likelihoods I was under the assumption that my log likelihoods will only ever increase after each iteration as in start negative and slowly increase and become more positive. My current log likelihoods after printing show that sometimes it increases and sometimes it decreases. To calculate my log likelihoods Im multiplying document term prob and topic word prob then summing by rows, taking the log of that, and multiplying it by the term doc matrix. This gives me a list of length num documents that I then sum and append onto my likelihoods. Can anyone provide some insight as to whether the increasing decreasing likelihoods is the result of my likelihood calculation or some other issue? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Likelihood would only increase as mentioned explicitly in lectures and quizzes - either your M or E part isn’t right if you are seeing vacillating values for likelihoods.

 But the method says : "self.term_doc_matrix\[i\]\[j\] is the count of term j in document i" . I do understand the document i , i.e. it starts from 0th index document. But what does it mean by jth index term ? Can someone please explain. I am stuck in this stage . Please some help me proceed.  Regards,  Anupam Ojha REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: first of all there's no way to really check whether you're building the term_doc_matrix correctly if you're using the test.txt... like i said in my hints.. make a trivial example . it'll help you out. the jth index term is referring to the fact that if there are 5 documents and i have 3 unique vocabs... I will have a 5x3 matrix in where the jth term is associated with the vocab.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I get your point. From what you are saying , it should be 1000 * 7(unique words i.e. vocabulary) matrix, which is the transpose of what I have mentioned. But in this example , which word is j = 0? is it Chicago? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: depends on how you're building it . But yes it should be corresponding to the vocabulary list. You're in control when you construct that matrix... so whatever you want to do lol . you just need to create the mappings yourself  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: This is how you can visualize `term_doc_matrix` ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5515250c-bb6e-45d5-9b0c-5d9898f384fe/image.png)  where, doci is the i th document is documents array termj is the j th term in vocabulary array  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: think it's flipped P:  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: good catch in terms of i and j.. yes fixed it. 
THREAD: expectation_step() I don't understand how I can get 1000 x 2 x 6 matrix by multiplying document_topic_prob(2x1000) and topic_word_prob(6x2). Can anyone explain how's this is possible? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: These two posts gives a good explanation of the intermediate logic: #1420 #1429  if that helps you.  Also this, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089893/understanding-numpys-einsum   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: so what's really going on here isn't a traditional matrix multiplication per se... but basically for each document, we are generating a topic by word joint probability that is hidden per the E step of the EM step.   numpy einsum is really helpful for generating this joint probability  as ujjal pointed out and i've pointed out in the other posts . Read the examples in StackOverflow ! there's an example of generating a 3D array from two 2D arrays.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the other option is to use loops to generate this joint probability  
THREAD: Updating Z in M-Step I am a bit confused on this part, but how can I properly multiply the term_doc_matrix with my topic_prob given their shapes? In addition, would this updated Z matrix be used when calculating both P(w | z) and P(z | d)? I believe I have my einsum and updating of the parameters correct, but I an't figure out how to fit in the term_doc_matrix.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: you're on the right path if you're using einsum in M step as well ! the term_doc_matrix is the c(w,d) so you have to use it with the Z(topic_prob) matrix. Recall what the M step is doing.    ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f4e61937-ad3c-467a-87ef-2558dba095d6/image.png)  notice how c(w,d) is in the p(w|z) and P(z|d) .   If you used einsum in step E , think about how you used those dimensions to map to each other now just do the reverse ! note that the dimensions for all these matrix all share three terms : #of topics, #of vocab, #of documents. These will help out . Good luck  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am currently using Z and D to update P(w|z) and Z and T to update P(z|d) but looking at the formula does that mean I can derive both P(w|z) and P(z|d) only using Z and c(w,d)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, in M-step, you simply just multiply term doc matrix  * topic prob (topic prob is what you calculated in E step). then you normalize over topics and words respectively.  when you use einsum, remember you are just updating the topic word prob and document topic prob. they should have the same dimensions as before REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do I normalize over topics and words respectively? I thought the normalize function normalizes based on input matrix, so wouldn't I only be able to normalize term doc matrix * topic prob by itself.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes after the multiplication it becomes a 2d array so you can normalize it by itself.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How would this product be used to calculate P(w|z) and P(z|d) then? I'm still unsure what I would be using einsum to map then.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: this product generated by einsum is the value unnormalized... the terms you're placing in einsum this time are term doc matrix and topic prob. Read carefully into the einsum documentation example on stackoverflow and look at the examples and think about it but reverse. Similar to how you can use that to upscale the dimensions, you can use it to scale down the dimensions.   note that einsum is totally optional and you can just implement this in for loops if you want to lol  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used einsum with term doc matrix and topic prob to calculate both P(w|z) and P(z|d) and then normalized each of those results. I got confused but the multiplication of the term doc matrix and topic prob is handled by einsum correct? I REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep  
THREAD: Error while normalizing the E-step To my understanding, using the normalize function will normalize by the denominator in the equations. I've normalized both my document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob and am getting the correct shape of (1000,2,6) for my Z result of the e-step. However, I am unable to call normalize(Z) due to the following exception  ``` Exception: Error while normalizing. Row(s) sum to zero```  If anyone has gotten this issue, any tips on where to start looking for the error. I've checked all my previous initializations and everything looks correct.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: you can't normalize Z just straight out. How do you normalize a 3D array ? with just the normalize function. Think about what the normalized function is doing. It's adding the numbers along a row and normalizing per row. So if you need to normalize (Z) , think about how you can do that for a 3d array. Also think about what it represents as the Z matrix. Hint the dimensions will give you the clue here  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah I see. I didn't even think about what it meant to normalize a 3d matrix. Thanks.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lol no worries ... upvote would be helpful turns out this thing is like a bit of a game :P   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So the numerator of the function gives an array of size (1000x2x6), while the denominator creates an array of size(1000x6).   I'm confused with how this should be divided. Is the solution as simple as adding back a dimension to the denominator in order to allow element-wise division? This would create (1000x2x6)/(1000x1x6) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the way to think about this problem is not to think of numerator vs denominator but multiplication then normalization. So do your matrix mult however you want then just make sure you normalize it . Dimensions are important but also think about what traversing these dimensions would be like in python and what it means to normalize. Or more importantly when you're summing across "the x dimension" how does that work ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, it might be simpler to make a for-loop to normalize each row or column in this 3d matrix. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep also a totally viable way to do it as well  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Welp, I'm trying to do just that but it seems like the normalizer just returns the exact same number for every row of my 3D array. Any idea why that's happening? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i'm not sure how you have a row in a 3D array ? lol you have a submatrix in a 3d array. or are you talking about every submatrix being an exact same number ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: well, maybe I'm just understanding it wrong but for the z values for test.txt you're basically getting 1000 2x6 sub matrices right? One for each document.   It seems like the normalizer is giving me the exact same value for each 2x6 submatrix I normalize regardless of what the input is. So normalize(z_array[0, :, :]) and normalize(z_array[1, :, :]) give me the exact same numbers REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: then something is wrong lol and i'm not sure what you're calling in your function. Step through it and you can debug ! you can also just step through each item in a 3d array to get you the sub matrix

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes i have both REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you trying to instantiate (call) Corpus from another file or from console? If yes, then you would need to do something like this `from plsa import Corpus`  Also curious, are you using notebook or cli?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yea if you're using notebook to run through this , make sure run the line that defines the class first ^ before you run the main() REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The only reason is that it is not able to find the class definition before main runs. If you running it as a single file on console through Python command - there is no reason it should give you the error. 
THREAD: How does T and D correlate to the E step and M-step formulas on the slides? So I am aware that T means P(w | z) and D means P(z | d). How does it correspond to the following formula shown on the slides? I am having trouble connecting the dots.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/98782f12-beef-4cf4-8426-10519f57ef4c/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: This is the general formula for EM algo... you're better off looking specifically at the PLSA implementation of it. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/133b718f-1912-4255-8f77-5e42e68fcf6d/image.png)  In here we can see that D is just the pi aspect of the function, and T is the p(theta) aspect of the formulas for E and M step... I.e for E step you need T and D and for M step you need Z generated from T and D + c(w,d)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the explanation! That makes a lot more sense! Is the denominator in the E-step the normalization function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep you can use that  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do you use the normalize function, since it takes a 2d matrix as input (rather than 3d)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: To normalize the 3d matrix, you can make a for-loop to iterate through each row or column in your submatrix then normalize that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not sure if my implementation is correct or not, but in maximization_step(), I was normalizing topic_word_prob (T) and document_topic_prob (D), which are both 2d matrices.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: pretty much. To add to that : what is a 3d matrix actually ? if you're struggling to understand this... it's a list of matrices. (# of documents, # of topics, # of words) is the dimensions of this matrix. I.e for each document we have a joint probability matrix of topics and words which represent a joint probability. If you're struggling to understand this, can review some linear algebra cause I suspect this will come up a lot in other courses as well!  And it is a common theme I think throughout data science...  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Does that mean we can iterate through all the documents and just call the normalize function given to use (# of documents) times to normalize the 3d array? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes but understand what you're normalizing wrt and what the normalize function is normalizing wrt as well  
THREAD: MP3 Help Hi,  I am stuck on the E step method for mp3. I multiplied D * T, but the shape is (1000,6) and I know I am supposed to use np.einsum to reshape it to (1000, 2, 6), but I am not sure how to do that?  Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: guessing you read my post.. not to give the hint away completely ...  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html  documentation on np.einsum ^ is here... which might be painful to go through...  so short answer is this stack overflow  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089893/understanding-numpys-einsum  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lmk if that helps ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also, do you know where do we need to use number_of_topics in log likelihood function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: so you can use it to generate a for loop to sum across .. right cause you're summing across k topics  
THREAD: MP3 execution in local Hi - Pls advise how to locally execute the MP3 code.. is it python3 plsa.py or do we need to pass any parameters ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: no parameters are needed to be passed. just run the script in console or debug directly in ide .  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: On mac I'm using the command "python plsa.py" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, seems my conda environment was the issue..resolved now REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you have python 3 installed on your machine you can just use "python3 plsa.py" and you will be able to execute the program. no parameters are needed.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Grader works on Python 2.7 therefore if your code works on local machine, it may not work on the grader. Therefore, you need to account for this as you may have done in past MPs. 
THREAD: MP3 build_corpus I have a question about how to fill in self.documents. To complete build_corpus function, it seems like we need to read document. How can we read the txt file in python?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What's the file name that we should put in open() function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the plsa class has document_path as a member inside it. use that . if you're not sure what I'm talking about... check out some quick Google search about classes and python. note that the method is passing self .. so you can access everything in the class . ^ good to learn object inheritance if you haven't already for coding ... lol it's a basic tennant of coding .  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your help! By the way, at the end we need to remove "pass", correct? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: always lol ..

THREAD: M-step dimension For the M-step, we have the following formula. ![1635088656214.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/7ab425de-4830-4fa0-81ed-79a85beb5ddc/1635088656214.jpg) So based on my understanding, the shape for the nominator matrix should be (1000, 6) * (1000, 2, 6), which leads to the matrix of shape (1000, 2, 6). How do we suppose to reduce the dimension to (2, 6) by dividing the sum of each array row? The final matrix I get is of shape (1000, 2, 6) which doesn't fit the required dimension. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can think of this as following dimensions (where you need to reshape/slice the matrices appropriately):  (1000, 6)  * (1000, 2, 6) =  (6, 2, 1000) * (6, 1000)  =  (6, 2, 1000) * (6, 1000, 1)  = 6 * (2, 1000) * (1000, 1)  = 6 * (2, 1) = 6 * 2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: similar to how you did step E, now you're just going backward ! can think of step M as the reverse of step E to some degree I think. You can use the  np.einsum() function to help here. it's really simple ... just keep track of the dimensions with that function . good luck . otherwise the other option is to reslice and do it manually. from personal experience ... numpy is your best friend in data science ..  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For the normalization in the M step, it seems that a simple call to the normalize function is all that's needed. Is this correct? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes it should be fine 
THREAD: MP3 Extension Can we please get an extension on mp3? Because it is a bit more difficult and we also have to do project proposal this week.

Please give us some extension REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 6]: I agree. It might be worthwhile to directly e-mail the professor and TA's REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: i wouldn't count on it unfortunately...

THREAD: Hints for MP3 It took me a while and reading through everyone's post to actually understand MP3... but I'm going to try and compile this for everyone who's still struggling.  Tip #1 Understand the formulas first -> this seems like a stupid thing to say but actually understand what the terms are being summed across in the formulas i.e are they being summed across the words/topics etc.. this will determine your normalization factor within the formula for both step E and step M. If you don't recognize there's a normalization component inside step E and step M.. go review the notes first !  Tip#2 Debugging through this lab with an actual debug IDE and simply the test documents down to a really trivial example. Trust me when I say simplify the test text.. even with 1000 documents.. our human brains just can't comprehend that many words nor make sense of the data... There are two ways to solve this problem ... 1. make a visualization of all the text data or 2. make a super trivial example that's even more trivial than the test data.. (like 3 documents in the collections with 4 words or something) .. that way when you're debugging each component.. you can look and see each function working properly. There's a lot of functions in this lab.. so please make sure each function is returning as expected before you even move on to the next step.  Tip#3 the most confusing part is the formulas within step E and step M, refer to the post https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1354 . Mr Song has provided an excellent function that will simplify your nightmares, this is probably the biggest key to solving the lab..  i.e np.einsum() function will solve your lab.. if you don't even know what you're doing with this function.. my suggestion is to write out the dimensions of the matrices (all of the 3 matrices that we're supposed to basically implement T,D,Z \~ refer to github ReadME for what these matrices are \~ hint the dimensions are lowkey given to you lol) and just map them back to each other..  I think this lab is hard because we all struggle to understand and visualize summation notions... Matrix notations are probably much easier to visualize.. if you're struggling take some time and redraw the formulas in matrix notions and just play around with the dimensions until you can map the matrices properly to each other. The function above will help you. Don't forget the normalization factors in both steps!  Tip#4 Similar to how a lot of people are struggling with the likelihood function and there's more than enough post detailing what the likelihood function.. Remember that each iteration should return one likelihood summed across words and documents. If you're like me and you're terrified of long notations... remember that matrix multiplication can be expressed as a sum and that should help you with some of the terms..  np.log will be useful in this case.  Some useful mappings for the formulas between the base code and the formulas we see in the lecture   self.topic_prob = p(zij = k) ~ it's a 3D matrix if you look in the code... slighlty confusing to imagine but for each document , you have a matrix that is the joint probability of the topic and the word ...  self.topic_prob_word = p(w|theta) self.document_topic_prob = pi(d,j)  self.term_doc_matrix = c(w,d)   It's 5 am and i hate myself for leaving this lab to the last minute... i need to make better decisions in my life.. but if i can figure it out.. so can you ! good luck and don't give up ! take it slow and you'll get there :)

THREAD: Topic Models & Ranking Functions Hello!   My team was wondering if its possible some how to use a probabilistic topic model like PLSA to improve a ranking function, like identifying the topics of a document, matching those topics to the query key words and then ranking them? Or is that completely off the mark? I guess our question is if there is a way to combine them in some way? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Brittany,  Sorry for the late response! Yes, it's certainly possible. In fact, many early IR methods used probabilistic models alone to determine the relevance of documents given a query.  Did you have an idea of what you would combine PLSA with?  Best, Kevin

I tried running Ctrl + F to make sure, and there were not any instances of argmax. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What version of numpy and python are you using in your local machine. Are they same with what the auto grader uses?  (if you aren't sure you can print the version and make sure you are on the same platform and then possibly you can replicate the error on your local machine). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you check if you have any variables initialized to "None"? There are few variables initialized to None in Corpus __init__. Those variables should be updated in each iteration. If your implementation is correct, at the end of each iteration you should not have any NoneType variables in your code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, there are variables such as term_doc_matrix, document_topic_prob, topic_word_prob, and topic_prob initialized to None, but I have not implemented the methods yet that are supposed to update the variables. Just asking, is the autograder supposed to return an error if you only implement build_corpus and not the other methods? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using Python 3.9.7 and Numpy 1.21.0. Is that supposed to make a difference? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: this exercise does not depend on python version (at least it did not for me) since there are no version dependent libraries. Nonetype usually comes from the use of an uninitialized variable. Please check if the functions are using any variable which is  set to 'None' in the template code provided. that should be your culprit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, when I added some dummy values to initialize_randomly(), it removed the error. Just asking, is it not possible to check incrementally to see if the methods are working or not. Do you only see if it is working if you implement all of the methods in plsa.py? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can. I mean till you implement at least the E step, you can try printing the values etc (for example, when I started, I could see the vocabulary, its size, total document etc) - the code given also spits out some values. When you implement only the E step, you can see at least that, but if it is "working" completely - that would need M step and calculate likelihood both. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: to debug, try calling only the functions you have worked on in the main() and including print statements there. (instead of pushing and submitting everytime)

Team captain should also add team members as collaborators on the fork repo 4. As per the submission [instruction](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) in week9, Github fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc.  4. The team captain should then finally paste the github fork link on the CMT submission page in the 'Abstract' field. (we also added the fork Github link inside the proposal document too).   **CMT Submission [(Link)](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CS410Expo2021/Submission/Index)** - Only by Team Captain. Below are steps: 1. Team Captain --> Open the CMT --> Crate Submission --> Select The track  2. The team captain should be able to add the link to the forked Github repository via the "Abstract" field. There is no need to upload any documents to CMT, just a link to the repository is needed. This way, the reviewers (other students) can look at your CMT submission abstract and follow the link to the repository, which contains all of your project information. [*Note: This is lates update by TA Kevin*] 2. Team captain should also add team members on the same Submission page.   3. During the submission process, there might be  a `Edit Conflicts of Interest` page, just ignore and continue by hitting the `Done` button.   4. Rest of the team members doesn't have to do anything on CMT. But they need to have accounts in CMT using the illinois email address. 5. After the submission is complete, all the team members for that team should be able to see/access the submission.     **Coursera Submission [(Link)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/CjO6a/project-proposal-and-team-formation-submission-for-grading)** - By ALL Team members. Below are steps: 1. Go to coursera page  `Project Proposal and Team Formation Submission for Grading` which is located here:  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/CjO6a/project-proposal-and-team-formation-submission-for-grading 2. All team members should hit the `Submit` button   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Do we also need to upload it to github? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team captain forked the github repo and then uploaded there too.   As per the submission [instructions](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) in week9, Github fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc. (So I would assume submit proposals both on CMT and Github fork)  What is also needed though is to add the fork repo link in the project proposal document. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since the project proposal document is uploaded on CMT, why do we need to upload the proposal document to a public GitHub repo? I am not comfortable sharing my proposal document to the public. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Two place they told two things...  In the Repo [Readme](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/CourseProject): Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview/Week 9 Activities.  But....

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont want everyone to go through all the hurdles my team went through in last two days figuring out the best way for submission. lol REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I saw now the place to fold the document of CMT REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I see that you edited your reply, so will add that I am NOT comfortable sharing the project reports and presentations on public platforms (code is fine). The TAs should give us an option to submit privately, e.g., by giving access only to those who need to have access (e.g., instructor, TAs, and peer-reviewers). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi everyone,  I apologize for not making the instructions more clear. All project material should be uploaded to the forked Github repository. Then, the link to the forked Github repository is submitted to CMT, via the "Abstract" field. There is no need to upload any documents to CMT, just a link to the repository is needed. This way, the reviewers (other students) can look at your CMT submission abstract and follow the link to the repository, which contains all of your project information.     And thanks to Ujjal for giving a great summary. One quick notes about the post:  1. In "CMT Submission", point 4, the rest of the team members should create CMT accounts, but they do not need to do anything regarding the submission.  Best, Kevin REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Si, I figured out and double checked what was mentioned in the submission instructions document and repo README both places. I have added all sources of information too.    I see TA Kevin also replied in this post with same thoughts,  However, you can also send a private post to the instructors mentioning your concern and they can best advice.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Kevin. I updated point#4 on CMT to match what you just mentioned above.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I understand, but I feel it would be more fair to the person you are replying to if you would create a new post instead of editing the original post. The person to who you are replying does not get notified or has a track history about such edits and his/her original reply to your post might not be relevant anymore...  Regarding the second part, that wasn't addressed to you directly. I understand that you are not in charge. I just shared my point of view. Perhaps others feel the same way. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Oh. I thought edits are being notified to whom I am replyig to. Seems that it isn't. :(  (I had to edit the post few times to match all latest updates and sorry for the inconvenience my friend).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our group ended up uploading the proposal pdf to both Github and CMT as a submission file, since the instructions weren't clear at all. It seems there's been a decent amount of confusion in general about tasks related to this course. 
THREAD: topic_word_prob what does this matrix represent? I know you need the number of topics but I don't know what the other dimension of the matrix should be. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: topic_word_prob is a matrix of p(word | topic), in other words, what is the probability that a word belongs to a topic if my understanding is correct. A little thing I found out is that if you look at the given "initialize_uniformly" function, you can see the dimensions for the arrays they use when testing, which will be the same as you will need.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: This matrix represent each word's probability in each topic, with dimension (k = #of topic, v = #of vocabulary). 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 9, Question 2 Can someone please explain #1294 again? It is marked resolved so I thought my comments in that may go unnoticed hence opened a duplicate. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here the constraint is that both the terms are drawn from "same" topic model. So :  $$p(w_1,w_2) = p(\theta_1).p(w_1| \theta_1).p(w_2|\theta_1) +  p(\theta_2).p(w_1| \theta_2).p(w_2|\theta_2)$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Pl ignore, I deleted the post. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Imagine you have single word with probability A in two topics with Prob X and Y. then you do:  A*X + A*Y  Now there are two words with prob A and B. The catch here is to think BOTH the words as a single group (since they have to come from the same topic model) - hence combined probability of them as a group would be A*B (irrespective of the topic).  Including topic prob in this eq: A * B * X + A * B * Y  Hope that helps. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In reply to your comment: "All the words in the document are generated based on the chosen language model" which means we supposed that every word in the document is generated in one language model.  For instance, all from the background model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This is explained in the course text as well.  The course text says "the mixture model can be regarded as a single word distribution defined in a somewhat complicated way"  Start with the last paragraph on page 348 and continue onto page 349. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: is this from a book? Can you point me to it? I have been looking mainly at videos only. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: also, let me point out :-) that the prof specifically stressed that the lectures should be enough. not that I am not against reading the book. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is from Professor Cheng's own text book.  You can download it from the UIUC library for free.  This is from the Syllabus page of Week 1:   There is not a required textbook for this course, but there are several optional readings suggested in each week's overview page. All readings listed in the weekly overview pages are optional and are primarily from the following textbook:  Zhai, C. & Massung, S. (2016).

THREAD: E-Step Equation Explanation ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e0537ede-51eb-4f99-b7d9-9ebfb7724ad0/image.png)  Can anyone explain what is happening in the denominator? The notation is confusing and I don't feel it is explained in a very straightforward way REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are normalizing the value (probability) that was calculated in numerator, by dividing with the sum of probabilities over all topics.  So each term in the summation is the same kind of probability, as calculated in numerator. But in numerator it is for a specific topic 'j'. In denominator, it is the sum of such a probability for all the topics (1,...k), conditioned on the given document "d" and word "w".  So ensures that $$\sum_k{p(z_{d,w} = k)} = 1$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: The general understanding of this p is the probability of word w is generated from a topic k among a set of topics. For this formula, the numerator is the probability of word w generated from topic k, the denominator the sum of probabilities that word w is generated from different topics. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There is one thing may be confusing about p(z d,w=k) is that when I tried to calculate this p, I thought the words that are not in the document should be zero. However, the truth is p(z d,w=k) will store the probability for every vocabulary word for every document, because in the M-step, the c(w,d) will make the probability of words not in this document zero. And this is why the dimension of p(z d,w=k)  is (n = # of docs, k = # of topics, v = # of vocabulary). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you, your explanation helped saved quite some time for me. 
THREAD: How many parameters in Lambda Per my understanding, there are a total of N*M parameters in the mixture model. (N is the number of words, and M is the number of topics). Am I right? ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-23%20at%208.09.13%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e54bfc96-d370-4d8f-a905-02a712afb3fc/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-23%20at%208.09.13%20AM.png)  For the below function, the total number of parameters is N*K. (N is the number of documents, and K is the number of Topics)?  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-23%20at%208.22.11%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c11c3822-df5e-4ca5-9d8e-58ca69017cdb/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-23%20at%208.22.11%20AM.png)      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we also need to consider the degrees of freedom:  - $$p(w_1|\theta_1) + ... +  p(w_V|\theta_1)$$) = 1 , per topic model $$\theta_i$$  - $$\pi_{11} + \pi_{12} + ... + \pi_{1k}$$ = 1, per document  I suppose these constraints will reduce the DF and total number of model parameters. But I may not be thinking it right. 
THREAD: Vocabulary for test.txt 6 or 8 When we are building the vocabulary should we exclude the 0 and 1 from the test data??? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. 0 and 1 are for visual testing purposes only and should be excluded from vocabulary.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Great thank you :D REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No. Those 0 and 1 will help the EM algorithm converge faster. Think about the first 100 documents as a supervised learning problem. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could you please elaborate a little more? Thanks. 
THREAD: Conflict of Interest? Project Proposal on CMT I get a "Edit Conflicts of Interest" message when submitting my project on Microsoft CMT. I'm not sure what this means? I can click on "Done", but do not want to continue without the clarification.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It is like a conflict management system between author and reviewer. We have ignored it.  You can hit Done and you can always come back see your submission list and edit any conflict on interest from there too. So it is always safe to ignore conflict at the time of submission and just hit the Done button for submission (no doubt there).  I think even if you dont hit Done button in conflict page your proposal is still submitted. The conflict page is something where your action is not mandatory.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b4e5f84d-cf43-44f1-8451-ef5d8dc890ad/image.png)  ===============  You will find more details here: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/chair/conflicts.html#individual-based-conflict-management  
THREAD: MP3 Grade Not Transferring to Coursera I am able to see my grade through LiveDataLab which passes. However, it is not transferring to my Coursera account and just says started rather than my grade. Please advise. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am having this exact same issue, I just asked about it in office hour and was advised to message Kevin Ros about it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Did you use the Week7 MP3 `Open Tool` button to login into livelabdata instance? If not logout from livelabdata and try login using the `Open Tool` button from here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/d7yDq/mp3 and then resubmit the assignment once again.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0066e477-f3cd-4f4e-8c1a-32413570bf75/image.png)    Also see #1363      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you able to see your leadership score as 1? I am having the same issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same question, I do see leadership score 1. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As long as you get 1 point from the leadership part, I think you will be fine. Just remember to seek help in office hours. You will get your point back : ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Had the similar issue. Make sure to initiate MP3 from week 7 Open tool button. Might need to scroll down on the page to see the button. Once you open Livedata Lab from there, push the changes again on github to reflect score on both coursera and livedata lab. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'm also having the same issue. Does it take longer for the grade to update on Coursera for this MP? I uploaded my code and passed on LiveDataLab but the grade has not updated yet. It's been nearly an hour.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #1363 This issues should have been resoled. Anything pending here? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Anyone experiencing this issue, mine resolved after I printed maximum likelihood after each iteration. 
THREAD: MP3 Do i need to explicitly call expectation maximization and calculate likelihood function in plsa? Do i need to explicitly call expectation maximization and calculate likelihood function in plsa function or the grader will call it? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, call them in the plsa function. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have to call them on `plsa(...)` function.    Autograder wont call your main function. The steps you see in `main()` function, autograder will only call those. The dataset file autograder will use might be different.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You must call expectation, maximization, and likelihood functions in plsa 
THREAD: Issues with LiveData Lab Hi All,   Is there any trouble going with Live Data Lab? I am able to submit my code in Github and the changes are reflecting in Live Data but I am neither able to see the logs nor my score is getting updated in coursera.  Also, i didnot see any "open tool" for MP3 as earlier it helped connecting coursera to LiveData Lab.  Getting this  with SUCCESS message: ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-22%20at%205.16.50%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/dddb2e56-b89b-4767-b666-338efd936476/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-22%20at%205.16.50%20PM.png)  Not sure if the submission is ok or not. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am having the same issue. Livedata status is success but score is 0. Not sure if it is a problem with livedata or with my code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Few things you can try:  1. Did you use the Week7 MP3 `Open Tool` button to login into livelabdata instance? If not try doing that from here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/d7yDq/mp3  2. In the first function called `build_corpus` print a test string and then put `exit(1)` to see atleast your print is getting printed or not. Your submission should fail too.   3. Would be nice to see if your github token didn't expire although generally livelabdata displays a different error message for token expiry.   4. Clear cache/cookies  logout. Open Livelabdata using `Open Tool` link and try submit again.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Ujjal,  I donot see any  Open Tool button  for MP3. Can you help me point to that? Also i was able to see logs for submission attempt 7 and the print statements are coming through.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks a lot Ujjal. I missed the Open Tool button.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Supriya - I did the same but still having same issue. Also in logs total 4000 iterations are running. Is the iteration no same for you.Wondering if i missing something in code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My score is not visible via Coursera as well. I have tried all the "solutions" but none of those work. I gave up on this working a while ago. I just hope that I am not penalized for not having my scored visible on Coursera. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If it is running for 4000 iterations, then there is a problem in the code. Few things you should check  1. Use test.txt file to verify your implementation. The first 100 documents with the labels are key to verify your code.  2. You can break your iterations when the log-likelihood doesn't change much. You should use "epsilon" as the threshold.   3. If your implementation is correct, you should see the topic probabilities of the documents moving towards 1 or 0 in each iteration. Once the iterations are stopped, inspect the topic probabilities of the documents for the first 100 documents and make sure they match the labels in test.txt (i.e For all the documents with 1s should have a probability close to 1 and for all the documents with 0s should have probability close to 0 or vice-versa because of the random nature of the topics.)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Yogeswara. I was using the wrong matrix for calculation which was resulting in 4000 iteration.  I debug my code and fix the issue. 
THREAD: Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure I saw a similar question #1357 but haven't resolved my issue. My lab runs fine locally but through the autograder shows this error ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/60f9df12-0260-43d9-84c1-6111b0078e75/image.png)  But there is no invalid syntax on line 215, as there is just space on that line. Any ideas?  edit: I managed to resolve the error, it was the one detailed in post #1227 about the older version of numpy  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If there's nothing on that line, I would probably try deleting that line and copy/pasting all your code into a text file and back into the editor, just in case weird formatting stuff caused the issue.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The @ sign, which is an alias for np.dot(..), caused this issue for me. When I replaced the @'s with np.dot(..)'s this error went away. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was helpful, thanks! 
THREAD: Log likelihood decreasing (instead of increasing) As I am attempting to calculate the log likelihood of all documents as per my code, I am seeing some documents have their log likelihood getting more negative, such as: -206.78 -219.34 -234.00 and so on  For some others it is increasing in the right direction, such as increasing from -180 to -140.   However, the overall log likelihood (sum of all documents) is becoming more negative, but I am unable to figure out the reason.  I believe this is the opposite of what should be happening.   I have checked my final document _topic_prob against the first 100 documents, and it is separating the 2 topics neatly and the topic_word_prob also looks good.  Let me know if anyone has any pointers on how I can fix the issue  Thanks in advance! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How did you calculate the likelyhood? You need to multiply each log by the term count before calculating the sum. 
THREAD: Array Dimensionality Reduction I'm looking to create a rule that will map elements of the slide equations to numpy matrix form. Please let me know if I'm on the right track.  When I see a summation symbol in an equation, I am interpreting that as a place where the dimensionality of the matrix will decrease. Further, whichever variable that is iterated over during that summation, I am interpreting as the dimension that will be eliminated from the matrix.  For example, when summing over words in the vocabulary (w) against a matrix of dimensions (1000, 2, 6) - aka (d, z, w) - the intended matrix result should be (1000, 2), or (d, z).  Similarly, summing over documents in the collection (d) against a matrix of dimensions (1000, 2, 6) should result in (2, 6), or (z, w).  Is this the correct approach? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yeah that sounds correct!

THREAD: MP3 calculate likelihood I am little confused about calculating likelihood. From my understanding, likelihood is a multiplication of term doc matrix and log of topic word prob and sum this for all document is corpus. Is my understanding correct? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The log likelihood can be calculated using this equation from the slides. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4fd26771-cd76-42f2-b4f8-05c9f4235b31/image.png) Remember that lambda_b is 0, so it simplifies a bit REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Your basic idea is correct. Just the log part should the log of sum of multiple of document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob. Like: log(sum(document_topic_prob * topic_word_prob)), this is also a matrix. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So if doc topic probability and topic word prob is 3by3 matrix, multiplication these 2 will give 3by3 matrix. How i need to sum it? Sorry for asking this. MP3 blew my mind. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can refer to np.sum(axis=0) which sum vertically and np.sum(axis=1) which sum horizontally. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using below to calculate likelihood in MP3. Any pointers if this the correct way?  ``` self.likelihood = np.log(np.sum(np.matmul(self.document_topic_prob,self.topic_word_prob),axis=0)) self.likelihoods.append(self.likelihood) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you're missing the word count component of the log ... see below  
THREAD: How to get a 3d numpy array? I understood that  document_topic_prob (D) P(z | d) is the probability of topics given document so it is of shape a*b  AND  topic_word_prob (T) P(w | z) is the probability of word given topic so it is of shape b*c  E-step tells us to perform Z=D * T (and normalize) which would mean [a * b] * [b * c] which is [a * c] but we need to build a [1000 * 2 * 6] 3d array which should be a [2 * 6] matrix for 1000 docs.  I seem to be getting a 1000 * 6 matrix at the first Z step. Any idea where I am going wrong in my approach? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The E-step involves updating P(z | w, d), which corresponds to self.topic_prob in the constructor. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: The self.topic_prob is a 3d array. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you can not do the simple matrix multiplication here. Maybe you should go back and check the slides again. Seeking help from the instructors may be a good choice at this point considering your question is a little bit complex.

THREAD: Debugging MP3 locally + through submission 1. Is it correct to assume that the topic designations are just for local debugging, since nothing in DBLP has been assigned a topic?  However, our code needs to address this edge case of text.txt having topics assigned?  2. Is there any value to submitting a partial implementation to validate a subset of the implementation? i.e. does the autograder test just plsa() or does it also test the earlier implemented methods? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I think so 2. I would recommend writing your own print statements to check the earlier methods first, but I think the autograder just tests plsa? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 1. Yes, we will use test.txt for local debugging and result verification, and for the first 100 documents in test.txt, the label of "0" or "1" should be removed before adding the document to corpus.  2. To validate a subset of the implementation, I would suggest doing the validation and debugging locally on "test.txt", as the corpus and vocabulary sizes are much smaller and the topic of the first 100 documents are clearly labelled for easier verification.   FYI, I tried to run the program locally on DBLP and found the following: Vocabulary size:30140, Number of documents:10835 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes it is for testing purposes only and also for manual debugging. You can create a copy of `test.txt` and remove those 0 and 1 too.  2. Since you have privilege of submitting unlimited times, anything you want to check with the autograder you can add print statements and run in autograder. But developing it locally will be much faster. In autograder submission, you can see your prints in the console output section. 
THREAD: MP3 Grading question Hi, I was wondering how does the grading work for MP3?   Does it check the values of any of the class' fields (IE= self.likelihoods?).   Are there tests that I can also run locally to validate?  If I get 1 on the datalab leaderboard does that mean that I pass?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I got mine to pass autograder by print max(self.likehoods) once the algo is completed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In the `main` function you can use `data/test.txt` (lighter) dataset or `data/DBLP.txt` (heavier) datasets.  The autograder will call the class with its own test dataset that is not shared with us.  The `main` section is for our testing and execution purpose only. Auto grader has its own dataset.    yes, if you get 1 on leaderboard that mean you pass. But also make sure in Grades section of coursera that you received grade for MP3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3e6512e2-4589-4f60-bb49-c1a645eb8c6c/image.png)   
THREAD: MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param Hi,  I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is used to check your likehood converge or not. If you are not sure, check the mathematics limit concept.  Basically, your EM iteration stops when n meet the maximum limit, or the diff is less than epsilon  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Every iteration improves your likelihood a little bit. When the improvement is so small (smaller than epsilon), you would like to stop running the algorithm and take the current best model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Let us say that if you have a list storing likelihood for each iteration. The list is like [l1,l2,l3,...,l27,l28,l29]. Normally the gap between the likelihood(like l2-l1, l3-l2, l4-l3) will get smaller and smaller. For example, if you found l28-l27 > epsilon but l29 - l28 < epsilon(the first time the gap is less than epsilon) , that is the time to stop your iteration(since the improvement is so small) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: epsilon is used as a threshold for likelihood delta for each iteration. once the delta is smaller than epsilon, your algo should exit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Each step of EM will improve the likelihood. At one point the improvement between step n and step n+1 will be negligible. Negligible in our case means the likelihood(n+1) - likelihood (n) < epsilon.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My approach is to actually match the matrix operation output to the example in lecture 9.5.  The lecture example on 1st iteration can be thought of as 2 topic model.  The difference is the example doesn't modify the document-topic probability (our MP3 does).  This approach can help give assertion to E-Step, M-Step(word-topic probability), and log-likelihood.  an example file to generate the same starting point as lecture 9.5: ``` The The The The Paper Paper Text Text Text Text Mining Mining ``` Hope this helps :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'm feeling like I'm about to give up, this lab is a doozy...

THREAD: should the first 100 documents used as test data  Hi, I wonder if the first 100 documents in test.txt as used as test data and the rest 900 documents are used as training data? If so, what metrics should we test our code on? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: That's a really good question. From what I can tell, the first 100 documents in test.txt were present so that we had a very clear way to differentiate the two topics and debug/test our code. Ie. you'd know that as you start going through the EM iterations on text.txt docs, you should be seeing p(z|D)s that approach 0 or 1 pretty well for the two z's, since we know that the first 100 documents are generated by only one topic.  I think this is a bit different from having test and training data in the traditional supervised machine learning sense, for a couple of potential reasons:  -  If you were to talk about test and training data in the more traditional supervised ML sense, you'd need to have a dataset that is completely labeled (i.e. to train your model, and to then test its performance on a labeled dataset), which wouldn't be the case here as you might consider only the first 100 rows as labeled.  - In the real world, I imagine you'd not normally have previous knowledge of the Z's (topics) to "label" your dataset. Instead, with PLSA, you're assuming that there are X topics in your data, and you let the EM algorithm try to find the best parameters to increase overall system likelihood (this being an optimization problem).  - The closest approach to ML I can see PLSA as is perhaps an unsupervised classification task, for which you don't need to split your data into test and training data, i.e. because the task is unsupervised, you don't have labels to test your data against (caveat: this of course depends on ML approach, and there are times when you might still want to have a test/train split in your data even for unsupervised tasks -- see a couple of discussions on this on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31673388/is-train-test-split-in-unsupervised-learning-necessary-useful), [stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/387326/unsupervised-learning-train-test-division), and [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-test-set-required-for-the-unsupervised-learning)). 
THREAD: initialize_randomly() The template code we're given says  ``` # Randomly initialize the matrices: document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob ``` I get the intuition for what these should be, however I don't understand why it is asking for these numbers to be initialized as a matrix.  How can I determine where to fill in the columns and rows, as opposed to just returning scalar values for both? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: When you say scalar values, do you mean just one value for each instead of using a matrix? Since there are multiple documents, words, and topics, matrices are needed to keep track of all the probabilities. I'd suggest reading the lecture slides again and looking over the explanation in the git repo.   And about where to fill in the values, you can just use the np random function to get a matrix, and then normalize so the values sum to 1.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: (from the README)  *D (documents by topics): this is the set of parameters modeling the coverage of topics in each document,          which we denoted by pij's. Each element is the probability of a particular topic is covered in a particular document.*  I believe this is what you're referring to? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I found it very helpful to write down the dimensions of the given matrices, because it helped with visualizing what each matrix is supposed to represent. You can take a look at the function initialize_uniformly (which is given to us at the beginning) for hints on what some of the dimensions should be. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Why to do:  for your e-step, you need $$pi_{d,j}$$(storing in document_topic_prob matrix) and p(w| $$theta_j$$) (storing in topic_word_prob) to compute p($$z_{d,w}$$ = j), so you need to initialize values in two matrics.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/11deb3b2-4f17-4318-9e78-dbb3e3a1fdc4/image.png)      How to do:  One of the easiest way to determine the dimension of the two matrices: referring to the below completed function initialize_uniformly(). The two functions are almost the same. The only difference is that initialize_randomly() filling matrices with random values and initialize_uniformly() filling matrices with ones( and then normalized)

I believe you are correct.  my self.topic_prob.**shape** for the test set is then (1000, 2, 6) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, self.topic_prob is initialized in the plsa function, so that helped guide me on the shape it's expecting. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, your assumption is correct . Consider this as an array of 3 dimention [document, topic, word], in your case the topic probablity would be [5,3,8] , remember pi is dependent on document here unlike single topic and background model ...  
THREAD: P(z | d) and P(w | z) Not confident in these two concepts. So I'd like to double-check whether I misunderstood them.   Assume  we have **4 documents**:  D1, D2, D3, D4 The corresponding **z values (assume we have 3 topics)** are: 0, 1, 2, 0  Hence:  P(z | D1) =P(z | D4)= 2/4 P(z | D2) = P(z | D3) = 1/4  Assume **D1 = {'man', 'boy'}**, hence: P('man' | z ) = 1/2 * 2/4 = 1/4  Are they correct? Thanks for any comments.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think P(z | d) -which I think is the same as the pi sub djs from lectures- is the document topic probability for a document. A document can be linked/covered by multiple Z's, and adding all Z's over a document would give you an overall probability of 1 (100%). In your example, what would need to be truth is that:  p(z1 | D1) + p(z2 | D1) + p(z3 | D1) = 1 p(z1 | D2) + p(z2 | D2) + p(z3 | D2) = 1 p(z1 | D3) + p(z2 | D3) + p(z3 | D3) = 1 p(z1 | D4) + p(z2 | D4) + p(z3 | D4) = 1  (I'm calling z1, z2, and z3 the 3 topics you mentioned)  From the lecture:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/edf85050-185d-4de0-aaca-0dc191635271/image.png)  On the other hand, P(w | z) is the probability that a word comes from a topic,  and here what would need to be truth is that, if you were saying that man and boy come from the same topic -let's call it z1- then:  P (man | z1) + P (boy | z1) = 1 (similar to above), see:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c0fe237e-196f-4a81-bde6-0128d0133fa2/image.png)  I hope that helps! I think the main thing to realize is that many topics can be linked to a single document, and that over the same topic, when adding each individual word probability, they should add up to 100%.

THREAD: number_of_topics Can someone explain why do we need  to pass number_of_topics parameter to maximization_step function and calculate_likelihood function? Can't we get it from self.topic_prob? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't use number_of_topics parameter in both two functions you mentioned, and passed the autograder. Using number_of_topics parameter seems to be optional. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was also confused on this, since I also needed number_of_topics in functions where it wasn't passed in directly. I don't think it matters too much if you use number_of_topics vs. self.topic_prob, I used both throughout functions and passed the autograder REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The number_of_topics parameter should be the same value you get from the dimension of self.topic_prob, so it shouldn't matter which you use. 
THREAD: MP3. Takes too long to build term-document matrix Hi all,  Any tips on how to build the term-document matrix when document corpus is large? I think my code is now running fine for the small test.txt file, and want to run things on the larger DBLP.txt file now, but the step to build the term-document matrix seems to be taking quite a bit of time to complete. Any tips on how to run this piece effectively?  Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You could make sure your code doesn't do any redundant calculations?  The term-document matrix has a row for each document and a column for each word, so you can use loops to calculate the value of each entry in this matrix once. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Do numpy matrix manipulation instead multiple for loops , this will change the performance drastically ...  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Are you talking about this?  ```     def build_term_doc_matrix(self):         """         Construct the term-document matrix where each row represents a document,          and each column represents a vocabulary term.         self.term_doc_matrix[i][j] is the count of term j in document i         """         # ############################         # your code here         # ############################                  pass    # REMOVE THIS ```  This function shouldn't take long at all I think. I wouldn't worry about it.

I don't suppose you would be able to provide some help into how you were able to pass? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I reviewed my code several times, for the calculation for each matrix, and found several errors in my formula. For example, in my formula of calculating the likelihoods, I used document_topic_prob * topic_prob which should be document_topic_prob * word_topic_prob. There are so many matrics in it and it's very easy to bog up. As long as you can run success, you're on the right track and only need to debug you codes.

Because wherever the guess stars at, EM always need to find the maximum point.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fb0ca6dd-df45-4211-8c76-5effc68d2e1a/image.png)  Did I misunderstand anything?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: EM algorithm guarantees local maxima, not global maxima i.e it depends on where you initialise . You might be lucky to hit global maxima in case you initialise the EM algorithm which is close to global maxima   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Abhijit is right. yes the algo finds the maximum point - closest to it (local). so depending on the initialization, you may hit a different maxima. and hence the answer is false. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, Abhijit. I got the point now. So, is it possible to get the maximum point of global? If the answer is 'no', we must try different initializations for finding the 'best' point as we can? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's why you have the random initialisation on MP3 by default, run it few number of times and you might hit the bulls eye :)   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you. Good luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]:  Perhaps such functions are also not unimodal. 
THREAD: MP3- Build vocabulary construct list of unique word I am little confused how to find unique words. Does it mean that the word occur only once? Is there a python function to find the unique word.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: python supports constructing sets REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Or you can construct a list and use ```not in``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Start putting the tokens in a set() - it guarantees uniqueness REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: it depends on the context/group. in your house your name might be unique, but probably not in your school. that "context" usually in programming languages is modelled in a (mathematical) structure called the set. when you say does python has a function to find the unique word, you have to say which group/context too. Set is such a group and most of the programming languages simply overwrite (thus maintaining a single instance) if the element/word already exists within that data structure. it also means that in a set, you cant keep track of the other properties- for example "counts" of the word.  if you do want to maintain other attributes of the group (like count for every word), you can use a map or dictionary (key->value pairs) too - where the keys are guaranteed to be unique, and values could be duplicated. I apologize, this answer is probably much more than what you asked for. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hint:  Numpy does this in a single function (try your best guess)...  It takes numpy array as an argument. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Numpy worked well for me to quickly identify unique words, so you may want to look into that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: use a set() data structure :)

THREAD: MP3 What is the expected output for MP3? I did go through the video slides for 9.7 and 9.8 but I'm not sure if I understand the question. Any sort of guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See #1034 also  It is expected for you to implement EM algo. The code architecture is there. You need to implement several functions.  To do this, you need to really understand the EM also, like how to init variables, how to calc E, to calc M ....  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Make sure you write the functions properly since the grader seems to call these functions to validate your logic . plsa function also needs to modify to call E, M and log liklihood steps  
THREAD: What's the dimension of likelihood in MP3? I'm still struggling with calculating the final likelihood. I think the final likelihood should be a N-dimensional array (N is the number of documents) cause we have to calculate the likelihood for each document. Is my understanding right? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The likelihood should be of one dimension at last. You will get a double number, and will converges to a fixed value. When it becomes stable (see one parameter delta like 0.001) , the iteration is supposed to stop. Or you have looped enough n times depends on which condition meets first. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You get the likelihood of each word in each document, and sum then to get the likelihood of each document in total, and finally sum all to get one value. You may refer the formula in Slide 7 below. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%209.25.05%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b916c6f3-aa91-452f-801b-a1650107c4e6/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%209.25.05%20PM.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since lamda-b is 0 as per MP3, your log likelihood function is only ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e6fcf467-5c5f-4f24-a972-cf827944b205/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I finally passed the auto-grader. So for my MP3, the self.likelihoods = [ ] is a list where I appended the likelihoods of each document (I calculated the likelihood for each doc first), the final likelihood which we used to compare in the iteration is only one variable (the collection likelihood which is the sum of likelihoods of all docs). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you clarify this a bit? Do you mean that you updated self.likelihoods at each step so that self.likelihoods was a dxn matrix (d = # of docs, n = # of iterations)? I'm trying to figure out why my code doesn't pass the autograder. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I calculated the likelihood of each document. The likelihood is just a double number for each document, I stored them in the self.liklihoods (one dimension, d = # of docs). At last, just sum up to get the final likelihood for the whole collection. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What about the iterations? My impression is that for each iteration, we should produce a single log-likelihood value. At the end of all the iterations, our self.likelihoods should be a basic array of size max_iterations. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For each iteration, we calculate the "new" likelihood and compare that to the "current_likelihood". self.likelihoods an array of length # docs.  For the purpose of comparison, all elements of self.likelihood should get summed up (storing the resulting sum for the next iteration if the likelihood is still improving)

But in the lecture slides, $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ seems to be determined by user, and is fixed.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/281c5ae8-a4f7-479d-b9ff-0c76ecb85c55/image.png)  In the E-step and M-step, it seems that $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ is untouched. We only learn $$p(w|\theta_j), \forall j\in[1,k]$$. How can we learn $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ in this process?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/79010278-0d1a-4d0b-86b4-f9485b0d59ee/image.png)  Thanks for any advice.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't know the answer to that question. I am guessing that known=can be learned. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The answer is shown in the first figure. If it is learnt, I think the value should keep changing during the E-step or M-step, rather than fixed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: $$\lambda_B$$ is fixed and determined by the user, as stated in the slides. In the option B, 'the probability of background', however, is not $$\lambda_B$$, it is $$p(w|\theta_B)$$. It indicates the probability of a specific word is from the background. The get $$p(w|\theta_B)$$, a random value is assumed at the initial step, and the EM algorithm is used to iteratively solve (learn) the value of $$p(w|\theta_B)$$. Eventually the algorithm output converges and the estimation of $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ is obtained/learned.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! I agree with you that the 'probability of a of background' is $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ rather than $$\lambda_B$$. But in the third figure, it seems that $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ is fixed in E-step and M-step as well. How can it be learnt? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, I think I messed up.

You may want to check 1) build term-doc matrix and 2) Create the counter arrays. Maybe there is a loop that does not end?

THREAD: How to compute Log Likelihood in MP3? I am still confused about the implementation of calculating the log-likelihood. Shall we use the below formula? And also seems like the question -  #1224 is not solved yet, anyone can reply?  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-19%20at%202.20.20%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c609e6b7-117b-4e74-9b0e-22ad98cbefcb/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-19%20at%202.20.20%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Yes, this is the formula we use to get the log-likelihood. It is equivalent to the formula in the PLSA slides, page 9. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.27.18%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1ce48a59-426f-4186-886f-0ee980e4cfc7/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.27.18%20AM.png) Because there is no background language model, $$\lambda_B=0$$.  A side note is that numpy has a log function for you to get the log of a matrix element wise, if you need.

THREAD: Where can we find questions for the course project proposal? I assume we have to submit the course project proposal to the git fork, and there should be some questions need us to answer in the proposal. Where can we find the questions? Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can find them here under the respective theme section:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubzdWekH2WLzft-IaSnkYflKrR7DqW-X7WsWiG30loI/edit 
THREAD: Project Proposal Submission Reminder Hello everyone,  This is just a reminder that by now, every team should have filled out the Google sheet indicating the team members and project track / topic: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwQW_q9AKCplRDQUhgXYIP9Kg0xRb_nRo0bbx1FeJ7I/edit#gid=0  I see many TBDs in both the "Group Name" and "Theme Preference" columns. **Please update this as soon as possible.** This sheet will be used for grading and assigning reviewers, so it is important that it is filled out accurately and completely.   Moreover, the submissions on CMT are now unlocked. Please follow the instructions in Week 9 Graded Assignment: "Project Proposal and Team Formation Submission for Grading". And make sure to match the submission track to whatever you have specified in the Google sheet.   As the proposals are peer-graded, it is very important that the proposals are submitted to CMT by the end of the week, so we can give you feedback as soon as possible.   Please don't hesitate to ask any questions! -Kevin  
THREAD: Tech Review grade out of 20% I understand that the Tech Review + Course Project make up 20% of the grade. That said, what is the grade breakdown specifically for each? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See #12 and #70 Tech Review grading is pass or fail. If you pass, your project grade is as per given breakdown for project. In short, it is mandatory to complete this else you may get an Incomplete grade. This is for a 4 credit student. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The review will be graded as "pass" or "fail" and is mandatory for students who are taking this course for 4 credit hours. 
THREAD: change topic during submission? Lets say im doing research and decide to change my topic from what I signed up for - is that allowed?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If it is after the Proposal Submission due date, I would recommend taking Instructors approval. If you send them private post and if they confirm, then it would be a safer approach. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There is no mention of topic change in the middle of the process here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  I wonder what happens if the topic we originally wanted to explore turns out to be a dead-end. 
THREAD: Lecture 9.5 EM algorithm confused about w’. I am little confused what w’ refer here in denominator. For iteration 1 for “The” word, P(z=0|w) is getting calculated by (0.5x0.25) / (0.5x0.25+0.5x0.5). Can someone pls explain how p(w|Theta) is getting calculated for “The” word in iteration 2. I think the numerator should 4x0.33 but little confused about the denominator part. ![image2021-10-18%2022%3A56%3A28.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/d00eae96-d979-4b59-aedb-865d77017cd1/image2021-10-18%2022%3A56%3A28.jpg) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The denominator is (4 * 0.33) + (2 * 0.45)+(4 * 0.71)+(2 * 0.71). w' refers to word in pseudo document (i.e. words known to be from theta(d). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought that's what w' refers to as well, but now I'm not so sure. The sum in the denominator is over "w' ϵ V", which looks like it means "all words in the vocabulary". Can an instructor tell us for sure? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I do not understand this either. I thought the pseudo document would be labeled d'.

I'm guessing you might be getting index out of range for that reason. You'll want to remove that specific code, since the file the grader is using won't have a test file with the 0s and 1s.

Any intuitive way to come up with that?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Background model is the probability of all English words. Therefore, the normalizer is that the probabilities of all the words in the background vocabulary sum to one.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could you explain more how to derive the following equation if the normalizer is $$\sum_{w\in V}p(w|\theta_B) = 1$$? Thanks.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a1416974-c502-461b-b878-d5643e372071/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is part of the E-step and it is derived from Bayes Rule. Defining: Event A: the word is from background B Event C: the word is W Based on Bayes Rule, there is $$p(A|C)=p(C|A)p(A)/p(C)$$ $$p(A|C)$$ is $$P(z_{d,w}=B)$$, i.e. the word is from background when we know it is W $$p(C|A)$$ is $$p(w|\theta_B)$$, i.e. word is W when we know it is from background $$p(A)$$ is $$\lambda_B$$, i.e. the probability of background $$p(C)$$ is the probability that this word is W (no matter where it is from). As it can be either from background, or topic LM, it is calculated by the denominator part.  It is not directly derived from $$\sum_{W\in V} p(w|\theta_B)$$, but for each $$p(w|\theta_B)$$, it is from the background LM and should satisfy this constrain.

THREAD: Libraries allowed for MP3 What are the libraries allowed for MP3? Is Scikit learn allowed?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is not explicitly mentioned that only numpy is allowed and nothing else.  You can try your luck with Scikit or any other package. However, if the library package is not installed on the autograder the autograder will complain and you will know that package isn't allowed. :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Math and numpy only REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The MP3 specs mention that scipy is useful for matrix-based calculations. So my guess is that scipy is allowed. I wish an instructor would tell us for sure, though. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ...and the autograder doesn't support scipy. Out of luck there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you only need numpy... don't think you need scikit since you're not doing any machine learning

THREAD: Lecture 8.7 generative model for text mining This concept confuse me a bit. My understanding is to  1) Count the probability of all the text in document. 2) Based on this,generate probable text data (using unigram or other model) considering the lambda parameters which contains probable topic and their probability in document. 3) Now adjust the lambda parameter to find the closest probable generated text data model with the actual one.(Shown in graph) Is this the correct understanding? ![image2021-10-17%2015%3A35%3A58.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ec5aca7c-2910-41f1-86f0-99dddc61cc68/image2021-10-17%2015%3A35%3A58.jpg)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think that seems similar to my understanding!

THREAD: MP3 grader says invalid syntax but code runs locally I get a feedback from the grader that I have incorrect syntax for the following line: x = np.log(self.document_topic_prob @ self.topic_word_prob)  Is this because the grader runs an extremely old version of numpy? Can the staff please update the outdated software on the grader? It is really annoying for the students to look up old documentation for one specific class.  Best Regards, Vedant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It was due the to the grader running an outdated version of numpy. Please use np.matmul everyone. I would request  the course staff to update the numpy version being run on the autograder. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the reason being they have Python3.6 version running on their end (the same python version that were used for MP1 and MP2). And yes, they can have earlier numpy version too cause the auto grader environment might not have been updated and uses a numpy that came during the python3.6. The versions can be printed to confirm that.  We might have to maintain the same environment what the autograder runs (both python,  numpy etc).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No they do not. the operator belongs to numpy and can only be solved by updating numpy. It runs very well on python 3.5, 3.6, and other python versions if the correct version of numpy is used which can be updated with a single command on the server with pip. Python version does not matter AT ALL in numpy operations as long as the numpy version supports it. @everyone it is the numpy version, not the python version that is causing the issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I do agree with you. In my original statement I do meant same thing you did (maybe the words appeared to mean different and I rephrased it).. What I meant is if we maintain same python, numpy and other external packages versions what the autograder runs, we might run into less issues.

Anyone doing project on similar topic can help me understand this part? Also I am exploring this topic, and it seems there is already labeled twitter dataset available which can be consumed, pre processed and used as training data for a model creation and then we can   validate the model with test datasets using the classification report. Is this an acceptable approach at high level?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You are not required to create your own dataset.

It must be at least ~2 pages )  If we are investigating features of a library how deep should we go? should we include code snippets? or do we just write high-level descriptions of what it can/cannot do?  If we are reviewing a paper, do we write a summary in our own words following  the submission guideline?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Specific format wasn't mentioned.

THREAD: Can on-campus students have an option to take the exam with cbtf instead od ProctorU To begin with, my proctorU experience was far from decent. I got disconnected because they had "something wrong" on their side. Unfortunately the proctor decided to log me out and leave me hanging for about 20 mins. 20 mins of my exam time was wasted. In this time I could have easily revised my answers and thought more deeply than eye-balling the few MCQs I did. This is one of the worst exam taking experiences I've had with a university course. Thankfully I did decent enough to not regret my performance despite the unnecessary time pressure. I request the staff to try and arrange a few CBTF windows for the on campus students. CS 421 had proctorU for the online masters students and CBTF for the on campus students. Can CS 410 please do the same?

Please use a subject line that contains the keyword CS410DSO all together.  Of course, your subject line, you can contain other keywords based on your question.  And then, if you don't receive a reply from us by email in a timely manner, join an office-hour.  Now, we would do our best to reply to your emails but then, depending on the number of emails,  depending on our own schedule, we may not be able to always reply to your emails in a timely manner.

THREAD: Expectation-Maximization Confusion I have a question from these slides from week 9  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a1d2c716-ab83-43fd-96a6-24ac98a6cb15/image.png)  I've gone through the lecture a few times and I'm really confused on what w' represents here. I tried computing the values from the example and I can't figure out what that sum in the denominator is over REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here, we have two topics. Each has a lot of words. And each topic's words follow a distribution, and we need to calc each word's probability.   Using EM, after enough time of iteration, we can find the stable probability of each words per topic.  Here** w** means a word. See the first column of the table. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Updated. You may need to really calc one time, so you can really know. it is not easy to get it one time.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Gah -- my original answer was wrong. Sorry about that. w' just represents any word in the vocabulary, and it has the tick mark to distinguish it from the particular word w for which we're estimating a probability.

Words in the query that also in the document.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Then what if that word is not in our document? That's is the reason why we do smoothing. If we don't calculate these words (in the query but not in the document) at all, what is the point that we apply the smoothing here? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's the reason why we do smoothing, otherwise the probabilistic will be 0 because the words are not in the document. You will get the point from a collection language model which should be given by question. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If it's union or intersection, won't that be explicitly given?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have options between external webcam, phone camera, mirror. Most of the time they dont ask anything. But there have been instances they ask for it. Depends on proctor and also the room. Try to sit in room that has only one door and well lit. If you planning to use a laptop, try to face the laptop webcam towards the door and likely they wont ask for anything. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I did the exam on Monday.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I would suggest not to do it..  people do face lot of technical issues... and that might throw your exam time off... Better take it to the least 8 PM. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I agree with Kushagra. I've had issues in previous classes with proctors not being able to type in the correct password/set up taking 30 min-1 hour. If you really want to do it though, you could check if 9:50 is even an available time slot in ProctorU REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: After 10pm deadline the exam on coursea will be most likely locked and you won't be able to submit it if you're still working on it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: If you run into issues that would be bad. Avoid the borderline and give yourself the unexpected troubleshooting window too. Many classmates spent upto 60 mins in the setup process.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it's fair to say that it's not worth it from a risk-benefit analysis perspective.   The relatively little gain through an extra hour or two of studying is not worth the dire consequence of failing to complete the exam -- imagine how much stress and regret you would feel.  Like the others said, with proctoru, it's not so rare to encounter issues/delays.  So it would be wise to leave some slack time.   Good luck! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have scheduled it at 9:40 pm and I just read this post. Now I cannot reschedule it. I will attempt it anyways. I don't know what to do now.

THREAD: Pagerank score How to get the Pagerank score? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/02d43eef-bf92-4a1f-adec-fb855f83836b/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You can think of it by using the Pagerank examples with links pic in the slide. So each node(among N nodes) will point to every other node and will have all other nodes pointing to itself. This means the transition matrix will be a uniform matrix with each node having a 1/N value as sum of each row would equal to 1. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The probability (pagerank) should add up to 1 (N/N). if all the pages are same, then I would think they have equal probability -thus 1/N 
THREAD: Parameter in Rocchio's method I know pseudo feedback is less reliable. But I still have no idea why beta should be smaller. Also, what about gamma? Should it be larger? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e7113ab3-edd8-4137-b660-aef8a73249d5/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Alpha, Beta and Gammae --> they control the MOVEMENT of final Query vector along the Original Quwry, RELEVANT and NON-RELVANT centroids,respectively.. Alpha --> just factors up the original vector  If Beta is smaller then the new Query will be LESS closer to the RELEVANT centroid. as that component is ADDED. and No, Gamma should not be Larger as it will SUBTRACT more from the original query vector..  centroid -> cluster of docs (relevant or non - relevant) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think that beta should be smaller because it represents how much your new query vector should care about the relevant docs. Since pseudo feedback is less reliable, you don't really trust the centroid of the "relevant" docs as much, so you don't want to move your vector towards the centroid that strongly.   Similarly, gamma represents how much you want to move your vector toward/away from the non-relevant docs. I would imagine that since non-relevant examples aren't important in practice, it doesn't matter much what happens to gamma. However, you might not trust the "non-relevant" docs are actually non-relevant when working with pseudo feedback, so gamma might be smaller as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Dose smaller Beta means the new query will  be far away from relevant centroid, instead of closer? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, i mis spoke earlier, updated. But there are 2 things .. One is the definition of Apha, beta and gamma and what they control.. and then what is the affect of their values to the original query vector.  Since Beta is ADDED to query vector, the more the Beta... the more we add to the original query and hence... the nearer we go to Relevant docs.. if its smaller then the query vector will be LESS closer to Relevant docs... The Gamma on the other hand is SUBTRACTED... so the larger the Gamma, the more we subtract from original vector.. i.e. the more Far we go from original vector i.e. closer to non relevant vector...   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So, the gamma should also be smaller, right? Since we also do not want the irrelevent vector influence our original vector. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That's Correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is the exact reason that modern systems remove the gamma component. They are basically weights apha beta gamma... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The lecture says that you should not give more importance to the algorithm (adjustment of scores) to what the user intended to look for (what he typed query wise). A large value of beta would override what the user types in as keywords. For gamma, it should be less (or 0) since negative feedback pulls you in all directions, thus creating not totally useful distraction (as per the lecture).

Can someone explain the process? Thank you in advance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you look at the formula for Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and apply the same with lambda being 0.5, you get this answer. Remember that probability of all words in the query = p(w1) * p(w2). using the P(w|C), for the second document, it will come to (1/3) * [(1/2)*(1/3)] instead of it being 0 without smoothing. Please look at the formula mentioned in the Week4 Lecture 6, 4th slide. Hope this helps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I see the formula that you mentioned, but i can't seem to understand how it ends up coming to (1/3) * [(1/2)*(1/3)].  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: P("online" | D2) = (1 - 0.5) * (1 / 3) + (0.5) * (1/3)  This is by applying the formula, which comes to 1/3. P("course" | D2) = (1 - 0.5) * 0 + (0.5) * (1/3) It is 0 because there are 0 matches for course in D2. 0.5 is the lambda and 1/3 is the P("course" | C). This comes to (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6. multiplying both probabilities, we get: (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/18). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So, as per JM smoothing, words may have a p(w|C) i.e. there probaility in the Collection. and based on that a smoothened overall probability can be derived for each word.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So, whenever it says WITHOUT SMOOTHING, what it means is that if there is any word in query which is not there in document,   then it PROBABILITY becomes ZERO. (One of the drawbacks of Unigram Model, that's why smoothing is required)  now Overall p(w1 w2 w2.. wn) = p(w1) x p(w2) x p(w3).. x p(wn)  i.e. multiplication.  So, P(Q|D1) = p("online"|D1) * p("course"|D1) = 1/3 x 1/3 = 1/9  (why ? probability of picking "online" from one of the 3 words in D1 and so on)  hence for D2 here .. p("course"|D2) = 0  i.e. the overall P(Q|D2) = 0

Page Rank comprises of two parts One: Transition matrix to navigate from Web Page 1 to any other web page through hyperlinks Two: Randomly jumping to any page (not following the hyperlink) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If random jumping didn't exist, then we would only be able to navigate through links, so 1. we couldn't reach disconnected pages.  2. once we get to a page with zero outlinks, we're stuck there (there's nowhere else to go).  This process naturally favors nodes with more incoming links because there are more ways for us to reach those nodes. Therefore, the correct answer is the first choice.

For B it was y for the same K (the Q says for any number of K). let D be the set of all relevant documents. It follows then  x > y (for any number of K)  it implies: x/D (recall) > y/D  Hope that makes sense. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Precision = number of retrieved documents that are relevant/number of retrieved documents.  Recall  = number of retrieved documents that are relevant/number of relevant documents.  The denominator in the two expressions above for the two systems A and B are the same since the number of retrieved documents (i.e., k) is the same for A and B and the number of relevant documents is fixed. So, the differences are in the numerators. if numerator(A) > numerator(B) for precision, this relationship holds for recall as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So, the only different parameters are "b" and "c".  Precision inversely proportion to "Irrelevant doc retrieved" i.e. "c" Recall inversely proportion to "Relevant Not retrieved / rejected" "b"  If A --> has Higher precision than B --> that means number of Irrelavant docs retrieved are LESS i.e. Relevant doc retrieved is MORE... that means Relevant doc rejected is LESS --> "b" is Less... That gives --> HIGHER RECALL....as Recall inversely proportional to "b" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: System A always retrieves more relevant documents than System B for any given number of docs retrieved.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's a one liner: Visualise the curve! At all values of recall, if precision is higher for A => this implies that A sits above B. Extend this analysis to the other way round: draw a horizontal line at a given precision, the curve above will always have a higher recall (x) value for A!

See the first pic below, if beta increase, R becomes a bigger and bigger factor.  Let us get a limit when beta -> infinity, you can know F is R. In the reverse way, F is P.  To summarize, F is between P and R. When beta increase, F is closer to R.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f46aaa65-0041-4dda-868d-521fb88b2091/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fb9619fa-a2ae-47fe-963b-28216f9161cf/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/745381a0-ca5b-4788-9e7d-51f9f290ca23/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please see #531 if that helps. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here's my take. We want a high recall having an impact on F measure,  If we set B to a very, very low number, like 0.00000001. At this point, the B^2 * P would be so small, it would be almost negligible, wouldn't it? Also, the numerator (B^2 + 1) would be basically 1. Our formula now becomes F = P * R / R = P, so you can see setting B lower results in Precision having a massive impact on F measure.  On the contrary, we set B to very high, like 100000000. At this point, the (B^2 * P) is so huge it overshadows the R in the denominator, so we can ignore the R. Our formula becomes F = (B^2 ) P * R / (B^2 * P) = R.  From the simplification, high recall will give us a higher F measure, if we set B to very high. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A higher parameter value gives more weight to the recall: this is because if we increase Beta, intuitively the coefficient of P in denominator will increase leading to overall decrease in effect of P over the final value.

It just have one level? Not sure if this is right.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: That's just the example given. The main idea is that the ideal DCG will have the highly rated values (values rated 3) at the top of the list, and lower values at the bottom. E.g., a doc of rating 2 will be ranked under all the  docs rated 3, and a doc rated 1 will be under docs rated 2.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The assumption is that there are only 9 documents that are rated "3" in the collection, so the Ideal DCG @ 10 for that collection can't have 10 "3"s, so assigning a "2" to the 10th document in the ideal case is the most optimal scenario given the assumption. Of course if there are more than 10 "very relevant" documents, then it would make sense for all 10 to be rated "3". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since we only have 9 documents rated "3" in this example. So for the 10th document, the best we can do is rated it as 9. You can check the video: Lesson 3.5 at 6:34. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is assuming that the user who deemed this "ideal" ranking thinks of the first 9 documents as having utility 3, and the last one having utility 2. Remember: *the ideal ranking need not have all values as maximum! Its an ideal "ranking"!*, something possibly crafted by a user in this context.

"minimum" implies that this is best case i.e. the other word always appears in some of these 1000 documents, and we dont need more accumulators.  The "maximum" i.e. worst case would be that all 100 instances of the other word appear in separate documents (mutually exclusive from the previous 1000 ones), leading to 1000+100 = 1100 accumulators.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In short, Minimum is the best possible case where least document you need.  w1 present in 1000 documents. and w2 present in 100 documents. For the best possible case, which ever term having highest number of doc count (in this case w1 document count 1000) will contains all the w2 also. so 100 documents from w2  is part of those 1000 docs too.  
THREAD: Simple VSM  How does using the word count instead of 0-1 bit vectors maintain the same ranking list if we concatenate each document by itself? (Quiz question) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Lets say using word count, the term count of a word is "x" in a particular document. By concatenating the same document you are just multiplying the EXISTING count of EACH word by 2 (doubling up the count) i.e it becomes "2x" But this happens for all other words as well !!! isn't it ? So the overall ranking won't change...  For eg. Harry has 2 wands, Ron has 1 wand, Dumbeldore has 3...  even if you multiply all their wands by twice or thrice or N...... it is still dumbeldore who ranks highest...  This is how i understood this.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Given a term from Q, if it exists in D, the corresponding bit is 1 regardless of how many times it occurs. Otherwise, the bit is 0.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: without TF transofrmation or IDF , there won't be any change if we concatenate the SAME documents (any number of times), as the same MULTIPLICATION FACTOR is being applied to ALL the words (in the query) which are available in the document.

THREAD: External APIs in Project I have a question similar to #640 - our group has a project plan and one portion of it is getting web results for a query. Would we be allowed to use an API for these results (such as Google search API)? I did not see anything on the project description so wanted to double check. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Molly,  You are allowed to use APIs for results, but make sure your project builds on top of the APIs (such as additional analysis or reranking results based on your own ranking methods). In other words, think about how to leverage the APIs to go beyond the APIs themselves, if that makes sense. We want to avoid the case where an entire project consists of just API calls, since that isn't very novel.   Also, Google search API, to the best of my knowledge, is not functional anymore. However, Bing has a publicly-available one: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That makes sense, thank you! 
THREAD: Team Project Minimum Size Hi,  was just wondering if I am having a problem finding teammates with my timezone are we allowed to work on the course team project alone? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sure. You can work on a project by yourself. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. Absolutely. You are allowed to work as a single person team in the course project. They are expecting each person in the project to have ~20 hrs of quality work.

That said, Yes you can have 1 person team (I myself confirmed it with TA Kevin), as far as you can justify 20 hours of project work.  Also,  there is a person on this post who I know as of yesterday is still looking for a teammate.

THREAD: (Lecture-2) TF IDF query term frequency?  Hi,  I just wanted to confirm my understanding when calculating the ranking using the TF-IDF weighting formula if the user types in multiple same words (IE: presidential presidential) we will represent the c(w,q) vector as 2 for the presidential term?  (so we will need to use term frequency vector for both document and query, not just the document?)  I was wondering if this applies to OKAPI-BM25 as well?    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: If your query is "presidential presidential".  term frequency when written as c(w,q) means number of times the term appears in the query (w -> term, q -> query). So, for the term presidential, c(w, q) here would be 2. Any where you see c(w,q) in the formula it would be 2 for this specific scenario.  If your query is "presidential presidential", you still have no information on the document d. c(w, d) means the term frequency in the document (w -> term, d -> document). To find c(w, d) you need to know how many times the term "presidential" appears in the document.     Does this answer your question?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, this answered my question thank you.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: In addition to above explaination,  The TF (w,d) in the lectures (Week 2) shows only Sublinear transformation for c(w,d) i.e. count of words in the document or term document freq.  So, the formula replaces c(w,d) with (k + 1) c(w,d) / c(w,d) + k   Now, just above that transformed formula it mentions k1, k3 , but doesn't really explains where k3 is used, while k1 is actually the k in above TF (w,d)  So, in expanded version of OKAPI BM25, the c(w,q) is also TRANSFORMED where k3 is used to transfrm the c(w,q) ---> TF (w,q) this is how the final formula looks like.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a872e805-461e-464b-a4d2-6828fe06c55a/image.png)  hope this clarifies a bit more. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you for the explanation! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As a way to approach this: Think of all additions like TF and IDF as an extra heuristic over the base formula: the dot product, which has two components: query * document  The heuristics we add in VSM apply to the document part of it, *the query part always is either bit vector or query count* 
THREAD: Beta-Gamma: conflict in quiz answer There is a question in quiz 6 asking if more training examples are provided, would it encourage more exploration or less in terms of the Beta-Gamme threshold learning. There is a slide of Week 6 that says "The more examples, the less exploration" (screenshot below). I also tested a few beta and gamma values with this formula and the result confirms this statement in the slide. However, the correct answer in the quiz is the opposite. Any idea why that is?  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-12%20at%2010.40.30%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/aa1e9803-a3c2-488e-b28e-8e4ee11f2fbb/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-12%20at%2010.40.30%20PM.png)   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you are talking about question 2, isn't that saying the same thing !!

Also try attempting the practice quizzes and graded quizzes. Then  If you feel you need deeper understanding for some topics text book would be good source for additional understanding. This is what I would recommend. But every individual has their own way of preparing and understanding things. After all exam is not end of the knowledge.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since recall changes only when precision changes, therefore, it's not possible for system B to have higher recall  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you can refer to this question #495  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Precision is higher for every k means that ratio of no. of relevant documents to total no. of retrieved doc is always higher. This means no. of rejected documents is always lower for a given no. of retrieved documents. Therefore, recall is always higher for A.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1cd98aca-8066-4eea-b31c-338a7454b0ec/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you draw a Precision/Recall curve of two systems - this means system A is always higher than system B for every value of X axis i.e Recall .

I am not sure how zipf law plays any role in creating the inverted index or making it faster?

If Zipf's law doesn't hold, it implies that many words have higher probabilities, so the number of documents containing each words will be higher. This implies that the number of documents in each posting file will increase as well. Hence, the inverted index would be much slower for lookup because there are more document IDs in the posting file to read.

THREAD: Implicit feedback in TR As I understand it, implicit feedback counts documents a user clicks as relevant. Are there variations of this scheme? I ask because I can imagine a user clicking a document, not finding what they want, then clicking the next document. Is there value in weighting implicit feedback by whether a document is the *last* one a user clicks in a ranked list? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Even I feel just document click should not be sole criteria for marking the document relevant. But I feel that is one of the most common way - better than having none. Another implicit feedback could be  time spent on the page. Maybe a combination of click and time spent on a page would be a better implicit feedback.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: From the lecture, through the user's click-through, we just get some ideas, and we assume they are relevant to the query. And also, it says this kind feedback is not reliable.  Pay attention to the following difference. You can find no feedback solution is perfect. we nee to have some assumptions.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cd12c5e7-e94c-4f9c-aa0a-5f66c1af5b69/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3bfd9615-5499-42f1-b4af-8a642d04d4a1/image.png)   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3843a25d-97ba-4bfc-9638-e2094c483e21/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also I would like to add few of Prof Zhai's word from the week-5 (Video 5.1).. He also mentioned about initially displaying a snippet not just a link   ```clue about whether the document is useful to the user. And we can even assume that we're going to use only the snippet here in this document, the text that's actually seen by the user instead of the actual document of this entry..... If the user tries to fetch this document because of the displayed text we can assume these displayed text is probably relevant is interesting to you so we can learn from such information```  Even if you see the google search.. it does display a snippet which makes the user to make an initial judgement based on the snippet to click on the document or not: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3a326c66-6b5e-4eea-becf-16d3bfa9f5a8/image.png)  Now this judgement can be initially made by observing clickthrough of few users, but over the period the relevance becomes more accurate by observing the clickthrough data of thousands of user on the documents.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Perhaps the best case is relevance feedback since the judgments are reliable in this case, followed by implicit feedback that includes some feedback from the user even though judgments are not completely reliable, and then pseudo/blind/automatic feedback where the judgments are not reliable.

THREAD: precision vs recall curve - why only chart the first precision value for a recall When charting recall vs precision, why do we only take the FIRST precision value for a given recall?  I understand mathematically functions cant have >1 y values (Ie can not have multiple precision values for the same recall)   But why does the instructor only take the first precision value for a given recall if there are multiple precisions?  Shouldn't you take, for example, some weighted average?   Also - maybe im a little confused now but why would precision ever be 0 as you go through the 1 to 10 ranked documents?   Precision as shown in the videos is the number of truly positive documents out of all documents shown to the user, accumulated from 1 to n.   So wouldn't precision keep dropping if the documents shown are not relevant, but it should not be 0?  ie here at D6, the precision should drop to 3/6, from 3/5 (since the 5th was relevant with 3 total relevant documents), but it shouldn't be 0?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/04fab6f8-4939-422d-a08a-39349d1f1da0/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: About the lower precisions being 0:  0 isn't the actual precision, but the actual value is unknown because we don't know how many more documents we'd need to retrieve to get any remaining relevant documents. So I think 0 functions as a lower bound. The instructor basically says this is a convenient shortcut to let us create a measure to compare retrieval methods. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Kurt already answered the question about the precision being 0. It's indeed an arbitrary decision to simply assume all those precision points to be zero, but this assumption is unlikely going to favor any particular method, so it's still okay to use this measure to compare different methods.   Regarding your question about the computation of the precision-recall curve, it's another assumption made for convenience. Please see this document for a detailed description: https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec15/appendices/CE.MEASURES06.pdf . Your idea of doing a weighted average also makes sense.

Note that "N" on the slide is the total number of *unique* words in the vocabulary, not the length of a document.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you, I should have read back over the slides. I was thinking of the direct comparisons of "Right1" and "Window8", which used segments of equal length. The final form uses vectors based on the vocabulary size.

THREAD: How stemming improves recall and decrease precision ? Hello -  It's been stated that stemming technique improves recall but sometimes it may decrease precision . I do understand that that when we club a few similar words into one, recall can improve but in what situation **precision** can *decrease?*    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Please see a very good explanation at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming).  Stemming may result in two words being classified with the same stem that may not be related. One e.g. for Porter stemmer stems "universal", "university", and "universe" to "univers". This is a case of overstemming. This will result in losing precision at the cost of recall. If our search is for university even the documents with universe will be returned, reducing precision.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Great, thank you !! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: recall = TP/(TP+FN)  and FN+TP=P (the number of positive examples). So, recall=1 - (FN/P). Since P is fixed for a data set, increase in FN => decrease in recall.  precision = TP/(TP+FP).  Overstemming increases FP. Since FP is not directly related to TP (i.e., FP comes from negative examples that are incorrectly identified as positives, whereas TP is from the positive examples that are correctly identified as such), TP can remain the same. So, precision decreases with increase in overstemming.  Understemming increases FN and therefore decrease in recall.

THREAD: Getting started with MP3 I'm having a hard time getting started with MP3. I did refer to the lectures mentioned in the write-up, but still facing a few difficulties.  does anyone have any helpful resources to refer to that helped them tackle the project? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may find some videos to know the general ideas of EM. If you have taken other courses like PSL, it is easier to imagine the main ideas.  You need to look through w9 lectures to know the background, how and why .... Also read the papers mentioned in the readme.  Then you may play the code to know the expected sequence (which comes first), and imagine what is required based on what you learned from  the lecture. You may got the idea that like, how to init parameters, how to store the data from the input file, ...  Without a whole picture on EM, it is really hard. You may look through once and once again. Each time, you may only make a little progress. But you will figure out.  Read the read me again and again!  I agree that this assignment needs a lot of time. If you leave only a week for it, you may fail it.   Keep this question unresolved:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the most important thing to keep in mind at every step is: what are the input and output matrices and dimensions?  There are only so many ways of combining these things that mathematically work.  I think half of the challenge is not getting lost in corpus/document/topic keywords - it's hard to keep all the matrices from blending together in your brain.  Take a look here: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/731 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The hardest thing for me to understand was the structure and content of each matrix (T, D, Z), and I had to view the slides several times and match that with the matrices in the project. Then I calculated a few values with a calculator to understand the mechanics of the operation and verify my code results. 
THREAD: References for recommender systems and ethical considerations? Do the instructors have useful links to discussion of ethical considerations of how recommender systems are used? It's not part of the course material, but U.S. audiences are watching some of those concerns play out in real time this week. (Well, every week, but it's especially visible this week). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: As well as recommender systems, ethics and responsibility of the intelligent system is a major topic now. Below is the 'Responsible AI' principle from Microsoft. This will be a good starting point to explore.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?rtc=1&activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr6  I have the same opinion. As the technology gets mature and easy to use, the risk of abuse is also increasing. I believe ethics should be a part of the instruction to be aware of safe use. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Below links will help, too  https://www.amazon.science/tag/fairness-accountability-transparency-ethics-fate https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/  I was a little bit scared the technology cannot be separated from our social areas now, seriously. We may witness the serious legal argument caused by the abuse of technology within several years. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I searched the course offerings in CS@UIUC   https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses and found that CS210 is the only course with "ethic" in the course title. Perhaps there are other courses that cover ethics. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I have a background in Psychology and Philosophy and have a similar interest in content push ethics.

THREAD: Lecture subtitle correction (week 1-6) Hi all,  If you are learning the lecture videos with the subtitle, you might be frustrated a lot. I am one of them. Unfortunately, the overall quality of the embedded subtitle is not good. If you feel uncomfortable, the attached subtitle correction will help. That includes the subtitle correction from week 1 to 6 that I found and fixed.  Surprisingly, the number of errors I found is 575. That is more than 7% of the entire subtitle line. Some are trivial (e.g., they is -> they are), but many are misdelivering the meaning (e.g., the battle of wars -> the bag of words, query light holder -> query likelihood)  I also signed up for the Coursera translator volunteer group to correct them. The lecture videos of the CS410 are also publicly opened as a Coursera course. The general public is watching lectures worldwide, and some of them will depend on the subtitle. So the poor quality of subtitles has the risk of delivering the wrong knowledge and degrading the overall quality and even reputation of the lecture. That is another reason to fix them immediately as well as help mates in the class.   Moreover, that was for me a really interesting experience in text retrieval (guessing the correct(relevant) word under context). During word correction, -	I completely ignored the common(stop) word. That does not help to understand the context. They were more frustrating than expected. I wanted only ‘terms’ for guessing. -	Rocchio is right. When guessing the correct word, I got to know the most probable clue is the neighborhood terms around the issue line. Terms in other chapters were not so relevant. -	The error had a tendency. I could guess the expected workload and overall quality of the subtitle with the first two corrections in the lecture.  Although I did not intend, my experience was an unexpected opportunity to understand the idea of text retrieval. I recommend you to try if interested. A dirty hand will give another aspect.  [Transcripts%20correction%20Week%201-6.zip](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/14b88256-797d-457a-9b57-8c80ea94ca81/Transcripts%20correction%20Week%201-6.zip) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for posting this. Did you manually do this or is there another (other than what's in Coursera) software that does this? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That was a full manual job. I tried to automate with some speech recognization software. They might be good for subtitle generation, but the full manual job was the most efficient for review and correction. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is a lot of work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yup, that is needless to say. But, that was also one of the exam preparation, so it worthed.  Also, I could understand deeply how such text retrieval theories were out. During the correction, I found I worked as theories(like TF-IDF weighting, Bag of words, Rocchio feedback) naturally, although not intended. That was also an interesting experience. 
THREAD: Advice on How to Prepare for the Exams The purpose of both exams is to examine to what extent you have watched all the lecture videos and digested the content in each lecture. Digestion here means that you are able to make sense of everything said in every lecture. You are not expected to know anything beyond what is covered in the lectures. Thus if a lecture only mentioned a concept X without much elaboration, you would not be expected to know about X in detail. The questions in both exams are all multi-choice questions. They will be very similar to those in the quizzes that you have been working on, but the concepts covered in the exams could potentially be from any lecture.   Thus, **the best way to prepare for an exam is to make sure that you have watched and digested ALL the lecture videos**. I emphasized “ALL” because I have noticed that some students have the tendency to use quizzes and MPs as a “roadmap” to selectively watch only those lecture videos related to quizzes or MPs instead of systematically watching all of them. If you are such a student, now it is a good opportunity for you to systematically review all the lectures so that you don’t leave any “hole” in the materials that we have covered; If you skip any of them, there would be a non-zero chance that you would lose points on very simple questions covered in that lecture.  Here’s what I recommend:   **Step 1: Review all the lectures**  1)	If you have already watched every lecture video in all the weeks so far, you can now simply browse the lecture slides to review all the concepts. You may consider using the EducationalWeb learning platform as it provides a convenient way to both sequentially browse all the slides and navigate into related slides (back and forth) as needed. (It currently only works on Chrome.) You can also watch the corresponding lecture video with just one click or use its explanation function to jump from any slide directly to the relevant part of the textbook. To use EducationalWeb, visit http://educationalweb.web.illinois.edu, or simply use the “Download” drop-down menu on a Coursera lecture video page and then select “Slides on EducationalWeb”.  If you encounter any part that seems hard to understand, you should then watch the corresponding lecture video and possibly also the related lectures to that lecture video since there is often dependency between them.  2)	If you have once left some lecture videos or some part of a lecture unwatched or undigested, you should now systematically watch those parts, possibly also the related lectures before that point since sometimes the challenge in understanding a concept X is in fact due to not fully understanding a pre-requisite concept Y covered in an earlier lecture. Again, you may also use EducationalWeb especially if you want to mix watching lecture videos with browsing the slides. To use EducationalWeb (which currently only works on Chrome), visit http://educationalweb.web.illinois.edu, or simply use the “Download” drop-down menu on a Coursera lecture video page and then select “Slides on EducationalWeb”.     **Step 2: Review all the quiz questions**   The exams are also meant to verify that by now you have fully mastered the concepts covered in the test quizzes. As such, some questions in the exams may be even identical to those you have seen in a quiz. Thus after you finish reviewing all the lectures, you should go over all the questions in those quizzes and check whether you are now able to answer every question confidently. Try to use a quiz as a “simulated exam” (i.e., answer all questions without looking up any material) to estimate how well you will likely do in the real exam. If you encounter any question that you are still a bit unsure about, go back to the lecture video/slides and review the corresponding concept.   **Step 3: Verify your understanding**   We will provide you with a list of the specific topics to be covered in each exam to help you prepare for the exam. This list is meant to provide you a chance to “double check” whether you have indeed mastered all the lectures as we expect you to do. So after you have finished reviewing all the lectures and quiz questions, you can go over this list to reinforce your understanding of the most important concepts and also check whether there might still be any hole in your understanding. If so, go back to the corresponding lectures or slides.   We stress the importance of watching and digesting every lecture, so, DO NOT review the topic list BEFORE you finish reviewing all the lecture videos or slides.   ** Good Luck To You All!**

THREAD: MP3 Clarification I saw that MP3 is attached to week 7 in coursera (this week), but that it involves implementing an algorithm that won't be discussed until week 9, which is the week that MP3 is due. Should we watch the lectures in week 9 that MP3 links to early, or will we still have enough time if we start during week 9? I'm basically just a bit confused about why it is attached to week 7 when it covers material from week 9. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The last date seems to be Oct 25 as per the Grades data  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1b27c515-52e3-4c4c-ae48-c2fb6b845b6e/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: The quiz for each week has that weekend as due-date. The MPs also have a similar pattern except (at least until MP3) MP3, which is due on 10/24/2021. Since we are given 3 weeks to complete MP3, it could include lectures for those 3 weeks (i.e., weeks 7-9). It also specifically states, "In MP3, you will implement the PLSA algorithm discussed in lectures 9.7 and 9.8" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I just viewed it and it spoke about PLSA which is taught in Week 9. So I will attempt only after I read week 9. Also it is due by Oct 24th which is deadline for week 9 materials. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I agree with you, it should have been attached with week 9 - its confusing going by the directive in the problem and the week it is attached to. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The original due date was October 10, which fits with week 7. The due date changed but not the week. Not sure what happened there. I appreciate the prompt to start the MP earlier, though, since we also have a project deadline on the 24th.

So the team formation is also heavily dependent on project topic and scope. For e.g. 1 member team should have ~20 hours quality work on the project  2 member team should have ~40 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 3 member team should have ~60 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 4 member team should have ~80 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 5 member team should have ~100 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) ... ... So with increase in team members project quality work also increases. Something to be considered while forming teams.   Large size team also possible for larger project provided approval from the Instructors.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A few more related to this question.... 1. Does the course project need to result in a working "system" or involve data analysis? 2. I ask (1) above because some courses allow "literature review" as the report. CS410 is not "some other course" of course.. 2. How is "20 hours of quality hours" measured? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes, the goal of the project is for you and your group to apply the topics that you learned in this course to create or analyze something.  2. Good literature reviews are very hard to do, especially with only 20*N expected hours of work and in popular fields such as ML, NLP, or IR. I would recommend sticking with building something, but if you're very interested in a literature review, please let me know.  3. It isn't measured per se, but rather provided to guide the amount of work that you should (and we) expect.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It depends on your project proposal - projects that aim to tackle a larger task will benefit from more members.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your answers. They all make sense now.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See #713   Yunan Zhang answered this question 17 days ago  It depends on how you define longer formulas. Exam1 should be as easy as freshman-level statistic courses and discrete math courses. If you understand how the formula works, you would know how changes in input would affect the output, and how to plug in numbers for simple cases. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My previous question at #713, "Does " If you understand how the formula works, ..." mean that we have access to the formulas (not memorized but on a sheet of paper, for example)?" was not answered. So, I am guessing that we need to memorize all the formulas REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Exam Questions will be of similar format like the weekly Practice and Graded quizzes (which is multiple choice).    Regarding the formula, as instructor mentioned in #713, they want us to understand the pieces how the components are related in a formula and understand how changing one component might affect the behavior.    #940 has more details about no of questions, hour and how to schedule etc.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes it's similar to quiz.

THREAD: Would Top 3 answers for MP2.4 be published after deadline date? I am curious to see how far I needed to go to achieve the most coveted spot in the leaderboard. TAs can you confirm if this is possible to be known to everyone to help understand the gap? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I tried a few times and gave up after I received a 1 (i.e., success, not #1 in the leaderboard). Since this is a graded assignment, I am guessing that there is some logic to the selected parameter values. I hope that we get to know what it is after the assignment is due. 
THREAD: LiveData lab issue I am trying to submit the MP2.4 changes to my GitHub repository however I do not see any submissions in LiveDataLab. It doesn't get updated with any new submissions? Any suggestions? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am assuming you created the webhooks, like previous exercises. Do you see any submission at all for 2.4?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I did create web hook. but still I don't see any submissions. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My token was about to expire for github, please check its not the same case for you. If the token expires, webhooks wont work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It was expired but I created a new token and did the setup once again. I see in the Webhook delivery response that GitHub account was not found. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After you generate your new token, did you delete the linked account on liverdatalab and created a new linked account?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I did that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Even though it might be an repetition. but you can delink all the linked accounts in levedatalab using the `Delete Linked Account` .. and try generating a new token and create a new linked account with the new api token.   Also, you can also make sure you followed all steps thoroughly step 3 onwards from the doc `LiveDataLab setup.pdf` that you can find in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I tried that as well twice but still no luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you see the submission line and see logs in livedatalab?   Also, do you see any warning sign on your webhook? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I do not see any logs in Livedatalab. In Webhooks I see HTTP 401 error saying Github account not found  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So it is an issue with your webhook. Check if you have copied the correct webhook url (with no period at the end). The webhook url you can get from the pdf i mentioned above.   It is still part of the process Step 3 onwards. Make sure you see no errors in each steps else you will have issues (like the webhook).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I tried everything, URL is correct. Tried prior projects as well but web hook is failing for all of them now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can paste the screenshot showing the failure.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: only 1 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One clean approach would be to delete the `MP2.4_private`  repo on your github profile as if it was never present. delete the `MP2.4_private` from your computer as well or just rename it...  and do the setup process from begining... it hardly takes 5-10 mins..  just take a backup for your `searc_eval.py` file in case you don't want to lose your work. Then it should get resolved.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did give a try to that as well couple times now but not sure what the issue is...even my prior projects are now failing when I try to commit & push with small changes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you use the right steps on the pdf while generating the new token and did you use the same token while linking the account in livedatalab board? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes I did REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you did all the steps exactly as in the pdf you shouldn't have any issue... :) Trying to understand which one you did differently (or perhaps missed)...  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 401 usually means unauthorized ``` The HTTP 401 Unauthorized client error status response code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. This status is sent with a WWW-Authenticate header that contains information on how to authorize correctly.  ``` So I still believe it has do do something with your token or access related. Also something I am failing to catch on your steps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also keep this post unresolved if someone else wants to join and extend help.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also if you still need help,  keep this post unresolved so if someone else wants to join and extend help.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Alternatively, reachout to the TAs as well in a private post and they can things better from their side.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Finally figured it out...the issue was while linking the account in LiveDatalab my Mac was automatically changing the url as GitHub.com (upper case) instead of guthub.com (all lower case). It's resolved now. However, thanks a lot for all your help & suggestions. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
THREAD: 2.4 competition strategies I would be interested in knowing how the out of the line (from my observations at least) scores got there - after the deadline for the competition is over. for example, I see scores of 0.422  on AP, I could get at best around 0.402 - was it brute force, modification of ranker algorithm or something else. Maybe some of the top 10-20 people can volunteer to explain after the competition - would be much appreciated. they dont have to divulge the exact numbers (probably to preserve future competitions' integrity) - just the ranker and the high level approach.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's hitting this section of code I think based on your output.  So, I'm not sure how you updated that part of code to run in your notebook.  I honestly don't think you need to try to run this in a notebook and just run from the CLI. It's fast enough. It's also better I think if you submit to LiveData for feedback against the test dataset.   ``` if len(sys.argv) != 2:     print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))     sys.exit(1) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you didnt use the command line before and were just doing it in a note book you could do something like this     ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/459caa2a-d99a-450e-8131-e810b5d53bda/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is hitting the `sys.exit(1)` code section. It should get the config.toml from the current directory which in your case is not happening.  Launch the notebook from the directory where you have `config.toml` and `search_eval.py` files and then you should be good.   However this error should not impact your submission to leaderboard as the autograder will call only your `load_ranker(...)` function. But you need to fix this bug to if you want test your parameters locally for cranfield.

THREAD: Leaderboard top rankers Did you write a script/binary search to try different parameter values, or did you look at the dataset and put in reasonable parameters? Or is it just brute force? I'm curious to know how did you achieve a high overall score of over 0.45.  Also for those who submitted 100+ times - did you write a script to help submit?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is almost impossible.  I manually change and commit to github.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I manually changed the values a couple of times until it crossed the baseline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The tests run really quickly. I just flipped back and forth between pushing a small change from my IDE and refreshing the leaderboard page to check the new score. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using https://github.dev/  This opens a nice VS code editor on the browser. Its so much easier to commit or change the file online.   For example, if your file link is -  https://github.com/.../search_eval.py   please change github.com to github.dev.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: reading some articles or papers on BM25 (like below) may help get to a success but still getting in top 10-20 is something would be trial & error.

THREAD: MP2.4 Testing NDCG on Other Datasets I know by default, search_eval.py tests using the Cranfield dataset. Does anyone know ways to test NDCG values on APNews and Faculty datasets other than pushing the code and checking the rankings on leaderboard? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think APNews and Faculty datasets are hidden. We can not access these datasets. The only way that we can get the NDCG scores of these datasets is by pushing our work and checking the leaderboard. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can try to find APNews dataset online and if you get it you can download it to your machine and test it.  If you are able to fine tune your parameters for AP News and Cranfield you should be able to score higher.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Maybe the faculty data set was the one collected earlier in this course REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The APNews and Faculty are hidden datasets used by the autograder for evaluation of the parameters. However, one can submit unlimited number of times to improve the score based on the outcome of their parameters   I dont think there is exact copy of those datasets available online. Not that I am aware of.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We'd need test queries and relevance judgements for the AP dataset too, though. I can see creating our own queries and judgements, but that's just feedback from a single user. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we could at least get the faculty dataset from the prior assignments. 
THREAD: 2.4 Github not updating the source changes I observed some strange behavior (or maybe I missed something elementary): when I make changes - especially in the past 3-4 iterations, the leaderboard updates the count (submission number), but does NOT change the scores at all. My local code gives very different results than what is shown on the score - and before these 3-4 attempts, my local score (for cranfield) was exactly the same as it showed on the leaderboard after the push (which should be the case).  Did anyone else observe this - or are there any suggestions why this could be so? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can confirm I'm seeing the same thing. The submission history shows success, the submission count updates but the score doesn't.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Looks like the issue is you have to use their ranker function ``` def load_ranker(cfg_file): ``` They're not parsing the script output, so if you're using your own functions to sweep through parameters your function's output won't get picked up by their backend. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: now, I am using load_ranker, but surprisingly, the output on my own machine is not reflected on the leaderboard. I am going to give up after few more tries, the "incremental learning" of playing through the variables is going into negative :-)

Edit: Fyi, I am trying with OkapiBM25, but any pertinent help would be really appreciated.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: You could start from baselines mentioned here https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/okapi-bm25-a-non-binary-model-1.html. Then fine tune them.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The baseline is using OkapiBM25 default parameters (1.2, 0.75, 500). If you do "gradient descent" (i.e: change one parameter slightly and see if it increase/decrease the score, then go for the direction that increase the score). You can reach the local maxima.

But then, how is alpha (and, in turn, beta) determined?  
THREAD: Pearson Correlation Coefficient vs Cosine Measure I had a question about the course content. What are the advantages of using the Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine measure as a user similarity measure in collaborative filtering? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: These are just two similarity measures one can use to measure the similarity between two users. Here's a naive example: When you hop on to your favorite online shopping website, the system will check how likely you are going to like say, a lego set, based on the choices of top 3 (or any k) similar users to you. How do we quantify this similarity? By using either the cosine measure or pearson correlation coefficient.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think these are the commonly used measures because they are easy to calculate (?) Perhaps any measure that computes the similarity of two vectors would be good.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Cosine looks at similar user and the ratings they have given to the item - it is easier to calculate and you dont normalize the ratings given by users (for example, a user which rates everything 5 is the same as one which rates only few movies 5), as long as ratings on similar items are same. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok I see. Is that in comparison to the Pearson correlation coefficient? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: no, compared to other methods where content rating is normalized (in a way comparing the magnitude of the vector too, not only the cosine distance).

My webhook is working fine and I am seeing the git pushes in livedatalab.  I have not faced this issue with any of the previous MPs. What might be the issue here? Please help. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You may missed this step to "Open tool" in coursera, and submitted at least one time.  Otherwise, the score = 1 in livelab cannot be updated to coursera.  If you missed this step, you need to do it, and commit it again to github to trigger the update. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cded7273-aad4-41eb-a3d5-17cf0045b18a/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had the same issue before and the "open tool" process worked for me as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It worked, Thank you!

THREAD: Can't beat baseline I've tried all of the different ranking functions and altered their parameters  many times to try to maximize the NDCG but still can't get the 1 on that leaderboard D:   Does any one have any tips on how to go about this problem?   edit: I attended office hours but am still unable to beat the baseline, please help, classmates!  edit #2: I finally beat the baseline! I had been trying for parameters that maximized the NDCG @ 10, and wasn't able to beat the baseline with an NDCG of 3.6 on the cranfield data,  but funnily enough, parameters that resulted in a slighly lower NDCG were able to beat the baseline on all the data sets. So the moral of the story for this lab is to test, test, test!   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: One approach is to try understanding and tweaking the BM25 parameters.  I believe that is being used as the baseline? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've been trying that, but the highest NDCG@10 that I've been able to get is .36 which doesn't beat the baseline  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Trying the BM25 parameters is one of the proven way of being success.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Refer to this article on parameter tuning for bm25 [BM25 Parameter tuning](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch) You can try this with cranfield dataset as it is already provided. If you are able to get anything beyond 0.36 for cranfield, you should probably be good to go.   If you follow the suggestions, you will be able to meet the baseline. If you want to be top 10 or so you will have to try to fine tune your parameter for AP news. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you want to meet the baseline, read through the campuswire posts and you should be fine.  If you want to beat the leaderboard, I think you are on a wrong place here - it's a competition, we can't be all No.1 :). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The current No.1 should be able to answer this question, until someone else has a better approach and becomes No. 1  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I met the same situation as well.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I still have not found a solution, am also going crazy with it D: REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm just trying to meet the baseline haha. Struggling with it  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for linking that article!  I've been following the suggestions from it but cannot get anything higher than .36 for cranfield D: REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 0.36 should probably get you to above baseline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The best way to arrive at optimal parameters is to loop through various values of b and k1 for BM25 between the values specified in [this article](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch). You should get values close to 0.36 and this should help you achieve baseline.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also can't get above 0.36 after parameter-tuning k1 and b. Not meeting the baseline :/ 
THREAD: Using compute resources Hi! Do we get access to any additional compute resources to work on our projects for this course?  Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: 1. https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin previously offered free credit to UIUC students but that has to be enabled by the professor. In my CCA course we got upto $200 credit in aws educate account.There were certain compute resource restrictions though. You might want to send Prof Zhai email or a private post and see if he can help.  2. You can also try GCP by using the illinois.edu account But using the illinois.edu address, the account might be placed in the illinois.edu organization and organizational policies might get inherited to your account that will likely put lot of compute restrictions too.   3. Google Colab is free too if you want to run notebook based python codes. You can check colab.research.google.com. Google Drive is conected with Google Colab so storage will not be an issue either. You can pay for faster and long running jobs.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That’s a good answer, thanks. I’d like to hear from the TA team as well, so am marking the question as unanswered. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I searched, and there has not been any discussion about computing resources for student projects in this Fall'21 course. It'd be good to hear about this from the instructors. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you are still looking for these resources then look for AWS. You can get a free account for 12 months and they offer almost all their services including compute resources within that timeframe.

THREAD: For people who successfully completed MP2.4 Did you just change params for an already implemented ranking function? Or did you make your own ranking function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: You can try whatever. We can imagine that: 1: Some guys write algo by themselves.  2: Some guys try various models with different parameters.  3: Some guys may try to take advantage of the dataset features.  To summarize, the ideas are unlimited. This is a competitive assignment, so not easy to share or discuss further:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: How do we do this ("3: Some guys may try to take advantage of the dataset features.") if we don't know the features of the other two data sets? Or, is this information available somewhere? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is entirely up to you but since you do not have 3 dataset , this is more of a "try and luck" exercise for me since during my exercise with cranfield dataset given, my ranking function shows very good result with given dataset on my pycharm project but it overfits on other datasets , after that I really do not know how should I progress here unless I submit "trial and error"   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I tried with BM25...key is to play around the param value ranges REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can do it 2 ways:  1. change the param values for BM25 2. use MP2.2 as a reference and create your own ranker function using MeTA.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It depends on you. You can finish this assignment either way.  I think the BM25 is one of the state-of-the-art models people use now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Trying the BM25 parameters is one of the proven way of being success. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 1. BM25 is state of art you can try fine tuning parameters. See [BM25 Parameter tuning](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch) 2. Try any of the other functions provided and fine tune their parameter.  3. Write your own function - not mandatory.

But they did some changes in the quiz deadline penalties couple of week back and I guess while doing those changes, they might have forgot to add the two attempts restrictions which will work good in our favor.  As of now I see unlimited attempts week7 onwards but I would echo the same thing like rest are saying here,  limit your attempts to 2 only (following the course guidelines) as they might reenforce 2 attempts anytime.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You will have two attempts for each quiz, and your highest 10 scores are used for your final grade.

Since it shows an error in plsa.py, which is the file you have to edit, and on a line you would be editing ("your code here" is at line 159), I'm guessing this is something in your code that's erroring, and you can't show it.  If it is building locally, check your python version as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the auto grader runs python3.5 (you can print the python version on your program and then running a simple program on autograder). I hope if that is not the issue for you in case your local python version is higher.  Moreover you can try with the exact package versions (from your error snapshot) along with python3.5 to see if you are able to replicate the same error on your local machine? 
THREAD: General ProctorU exam tips? Does anyone have tips as to how to best go about a ProctorU exam?  I'm specifically looking for technical stuff like what browser, browser extension, (do they have an app?), other open applications, etc...  I'm on Mac OS X... do people make new user accounts on their machine?  Setting up permissions was a thing when I took the data structures exam. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Some people set up a new user account for ProctorU for privacy control. I typically change all the revised settings back after the exam. It takes just a few seconds. They mainly disable your screenshot shortcuts.   ProctorU needs to install a browser extension. I usually remove it after the exam.  I typically reboot my computer before the exam and leave only the needed programs (browser) on.   Be sure to have a mirror if you are using the camera in the laptop since the proctors will need to check your keyboard.   Leave your phone in the room. I typically put my phone in another room, but once the proctor asked me to show him the phone and leave it somewhere in the room I took the exam.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: What if I don't have a mirror?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: With ProctorU I can only say, Always Expect The Unexpected. (Feel free to disagree but this is what mostly my experience so far).  Every time I appeared for ProctorU exam, there were always glitches (mostly minor).  I listed all the points below that would "hopefully" address the Unexpected portions: 1. At times the wait times were higher for a proctor to join. Just be patient.  2. If you are using laptop camera (which I did all the time) some proctor asks for a mirror some don't. Btw, If mirror is not available, phone/tablet would work as well for reflective surface.  3. I wouldn't recommend using a work laptop as they take control of your computer (with permission) to disable stuffs  (based on what you have already installed including screenshot shortcuts) and that might conflict with your permission settings (specially mac). But if you can restore those settings then it would be fine (of course, they dont enable it back for you).    4. Once you schedule the exam, Check the exam rules from your sessions. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ecb915f3-77c2-48c4-afc4-53dd7e3d8235/image.png)  6.

THREAD: Ranking update on leaderboard for 2.4 Hi all,  As many of you have noticed, the ranking for the leaderboard for 2.4 was a bit unstable.   Before, it was using AP news (first column) to rank submissions, which didn't accurately reflect the extra credit allocation. I thought I changed it to the overall score (second-to-last column), but it appears that I mistakenly chose the submission score (last column) instead.   Now, the leaderboard should be ranked based on the second-to-last column, which is the overall score.  Sorry for the confusion.  -Kevin        
THREAD: MP2.4 learning? What exactly is the learning from MP2.4? Is it just a hit or miss while randomly changing the parameter or is there a way to think about this problem? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think main learning is how to tune parameters of various models to achieve better search results. You could also improve existing models to improve the performance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: > Is it just a hit or miss while **randomly** changing the parameter...  No! Parameter tuning is not about **randomly** selecting parameters. You should explore the parameter space in a more sophisticated manner, e.g., formulate an optimization problem or perform a brute-force or Monte Carlo search. Also, you are free to implement any ranking function on your own or use the (combination of) built-in ones in metapy. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There has to be some logic to this parameter "tweaking" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is to help you understand the parameter ranges for BM25. For example the k parameter for BM25 has a range from 1 to infinity... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree with the sentiment here. Is this how the tweaking is done in the real world, or are there libraries that are built to optimize this? I considered writing a test driver script that would run through intervals of k1, b, and k3 and check the results, but I didn't have time. Maybe later. There has to be systems that do this!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think a script to obtain optimal results in my data sets will be better.

THREAD: Can we change back the rankings to default for MP2.4 I noticed that rankings are now based on if we were able to solve the baseline or not. This is pretty bad for people trying to participate in the competition since there is no way of knowing your ranking. Everyone can still know if they got the baseline right or not by looking at the last column. Can the instructors please revert back to the old format of displaying the rankings based on the competition instead of correctness.

I have tested my code locally and it works fine. I'm not sure what the issue is.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: based on the log that you have shared, it appears that the program is still running in the lab. it takes a few minutes to start up the execution in the log before it fails.  can you share what failure message you are getting?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am getting the same issue, I resubmitted using code that got me a full score and it still fails. This issue from the Live Data Lab side and I do not think us students need to do anything about it. I hope an instructor updates us soon REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had similar issue in previous MP and got failure 5 times. It was caused by MP Github Link changed by TA and mine was still the previous guthub link. I solved it by reseting the github link to ```Livedatalab```. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue. Then I was told that my Github token had expired. After I renewed it, the submission started again.

I am getting it as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try updating your github token, which may have been expired.  seemed to have solved the issues for others.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Do you have any updates on this? I renewed my github token and made sure webhook was set up properly. Still get the same message  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue and got it resolved by generating a new token. Thanks for the note. 
THREAD: Confused about MP2.4 scoring and credit I am looking at the leaderboard, and there are people with higher scores than me who have lower values for each of the 3 data sets. Additionally, there are people with lower scores than me who have received credit, while I have not received credit. How is all of this being calculated? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have that as an example, you can send a private post to Instructors and TAs and request them to look at your score.  The leaderboard ranking "view" changed today and it is currently not following any ranking logic other than the success and failures (last column) is randomly sorted.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The last column decides your real results after combining the results of dataset 1/2/3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/84aed718-f844-4289-9550-4b3d677f2223/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think current ranking is only based on the first score (APNews) not fourth score (Overall Score). I checked the numbers and believe the four columns are as follow:  -  NDCG@10 on APNews  - NDCG@10 on Cranfield  - NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset - "Overall Score" : 0.1* NDCG@10 on APNews + 0.3* NDCG@10 on Cranfield + 0.6* NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset  I don't think you will know whether you will receive extra credits after everyone finished submitting or stop trying new methods. Unless you have a very high overall score that secures you rank on the top.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Seems resolved. One of the TA responded in this post #951.

THREAD: Changes to rankin MP2.4 Is there any changes happening to ranking in MP2.4  I see my rank drop by 17 places  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes seems all jumbled up and not following any ranking logic except they are just randomly sorted based on success and failure (the last column 0/1). Maybe they are in middle of fixing the ranking logic. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  I also sent a private post to the Instructors/TAs and didn't hear back yet. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: On my screen it appears that they are sorted by the first column (I think thats the AP news one). I think it should have been by the total.

THREAD: Live Data lab token expired Hi,  My live data lab token expired.  So I made a new one and relinked my account.  Will this be okaying for grading and everything I already submitted? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If your submissions are going through again without issues, yes you should be absolutely fine.   I know few classmates went through the token expiry issue and didn't have any issue with grading MP when they submitted with new api token.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to update my token and sync my Github with LiveDataLab (I can see my submissions), but my grade is not being updated in Coursera, even when I get a '1' for MP2.4. What could be the issue?

I havent tried to subbmit anything but I guess Ill see later REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If your grade doesn't show up on Coursera, please contact the professors. I did that last week and now it works (my MP scores are visible on Coursera) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After you updated your api token, did you go to the LiveDataLab using the MP2.4 "Open Tool"  button. Previously classmates encountered grading update issues when they went to LiveDataLab directly and not using "Open Tool" button. Close your browser tabs with LiveDataLab (logout) and open using "Open Tool" button and see if you get your grade synced.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When I try going through the "Open Tool" my LiveDataLab login credentials don't work anymore. How can I fix this? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Any chance you forgot your credentials? Your credentials are generally one time setup and it should work. And I hope you have your illinois email as your account in LiveDataLab.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, I wrote down my password and username, but login still doesn't work :(  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Git token expiry and Not able to Signup LiveDataLab I think are not related (only linked account inside livedatalab is affected with git token change not the LiveDataLab login).   What happens when you try to signup again with your illinois account?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nevermind! It got fixed, and everything syncs up, thank you for the quick responses!

Do you know how your issue was resolved? 
THREAD: 6.1-6.3 Learning to Rank Out of curiosity, is there any particular reason Learning to Rank is an optional lecture in Week 6? It seems like a relevant topic to understand. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe the optional tag may be a holdover from when the course was either  - Joined from the two halves of "Text Retrieval and Search Engines" and "Text Mining and Analytics"; or - Contemplated as only for 3 credit students vs 4 credit students.  I agree, it is a good section to go through and relevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What David said.. And with other courses mostly what I have seen, they keep reevaluating the course content every semester and make minor adjustments to keep it most updated and current. While doing that they mark few videos as optional so students can still go over those videos for knowledge but there are no quiz questions and exam questions on those topics. Or even sometimes like additional reads ( like papers, textbooks etc) , some videos are provided as additional lectures which is always helpful.   The Instructors would be however able to answer this best any specific reason.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'd assume that it's not really optional and has valuable content since it's there for a reason.  
THREAD: MP2.4 fine-tune parameter What options can we use for fine-tune various parameter settings?  ![A2740EB4DF836833D1F80EF416506C17.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0250a043-5add-43e6-9632-ac6f0d0e50b1/A2740EB4DF836833D1F80EF416506C17.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used trial and error(Starting with default) and heuristicaly deduce the parameters, It did work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am curious how we can have some learning out of this MP? right now, it is just hit or miss by randomly changing parameters. Anybody have any suggestions on how to think for this problem? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes but doesnt seem like a very organized method (not saying I know of a better approach :-) ) - or is it the only possible way given the nature of the algorithms? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it has to deal with the value ranges for the 3 parameters BM25 takes. For example for the k parameter value, it can go to positive infinity compared to the other parameters like b. So you cannot have the k value in same range as b. Ideally k is a way higher value range than b. Objective of this exercise is to familiarize us to those ranges I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "...please make sure you do not overfit" - just wondering if this comment is generalizable across data sets. If the chosen parameter set leads to overfitting with one data set, will the same set of parameters lead to overfitting with the other 2 datasets as well? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Actually endless possibilities for fine tuning the parameters for any Ranker you chose. If you go through the ranker implementation and make yourself aware of the boundary values and how they impact the score then it might help you to fine tune better.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The problem with overfitting is that while your numbers might go up for the cranfield set, they might perform very poorly with other sets. if they lead to overfitting for all 3 (thus maximizing all 3 results), I would think thats the good news :-) at least in the given context. 
THREAD: MP2.4 Do we only have to submit NDCG@10? Do we only have to get the NDCG@10 comparing to baseline? What's my baseline? I'm confused about the requirements. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You only need to implement the model, which will be used for 3 datasets. You do not control the output. It is like 2.2. You need to implement the same thing,  but the better results are expected. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am guessing that we 'fine-tune' the model for the data set we have access to, and hope that this fine-tuning carries over to the other two data sets as well. 
THREAD: mp2.3 grading marking doc as relevant or not... how is this graded?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think as long as you finish the marking and submit your result you will get full credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have to mark all the listed doc either relevant or not relevant. It is based on your judgement which one you want to mark relevant and which one not.  Once you mark all the listed document and submit, it is then considered you completed the assignment and get full credit (100%).  That's it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This exercise is for providing relevance feedback on the search system and so that it can improve it further. This can only be done manually. So as long as you can able to categorize them, you should get full marks  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It's completely your choice - you need to decide whether a document is relevant or not based on the keywords. I.e., there is no incorrect answer for this assignment. Once you mark each of the documents that you are given as relevant or not, you're done and will receive 100% points for this assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You just need to do it based on your judgement and the marks will be granted  
THREAD: Course Project Update Hello everyone,  I hope you semesters have been going well so far! I'm writing this note to give you an update on the course project.  First, as you've probably read, all logistical information (grades, dates, etc.) can be found on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview).  Please note the peer-grading deadlines.   Second, we've finalized the list of project tracks and topics. This list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubzdWekH2WLzft-IaSnkYflKrR7DqW-X7WsWiG30loI/edit?usp=sharing). This document also contains past project examples and submission information. Please make sure you access the document with your illinois.edu email.   Third, because this is such a large class, we expect that many groups will be interested in similar topics. For popular topics, we encourage you to utilize the "Rooms" feature here on Campuswire, where groups interested in similar topics can discuss their approaches and issues, and maybe even coordinate projects.   And as always, if you find any inconsistencies, mistakes, or missing information in the above links, please let the TA staff know, so we can resolve it as soon as possible.   We really appreciate your patience though all of this, and we look forward to seeing what you will accomplish!  -Kevin

THREAD: MP2.4 Lambda parameter for JelinekMercer How to change the lamda parameter for JelinekMercer ranker? I keep getting syntax error if I directly add  metapy.index.JelinekMercer(lambda=**0.75**) and try to return it from the load_ranker function. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Try using metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75). "lambda" is a function in python and hence the syntax error. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, that worked. Why is it different when we use say the DirichletPrior ranker, that time i explicitly say mu=0.5? Confused when you say Lambda is a function, is it not a parameter for the JelinekMercer function ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "Lambda Function, also referred to as 'Anonymous function' is same as a regular python function but can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword." I guess there is no such thing as  "mu function" in Python. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: `lambda` just happen to be a python keyword like `return` , `def`, `for` etc...  These keywords are reserved in python which means Python doesn't allow these keywords to be used as variables within the program.  So when you are trying to do   ``` metapy.index.JelinekMercer(lambda=0.75) ``` You are trying to assign a value to python reserved keyword `lamda` and that's why it is complaining. Likewise, you wont be able to do operations such as `return=2` or `for=2`. These will give `SyntaxError`.   On the other hand `mu` is not a reserved word in Python so you were able to do the assignment. The original JelinekMercer function is a C++ library which was binded to python to to able to use those C++ functions in python. So while C++ allows `lambda` as a variable but python doesn't.   Only workaround is you can provide the value of lambda like `metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75) `  and you should be good.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lambda is a keyword to declare anonyous functions in python. Keywords cannot be used as parameters or variables. JelinekMercer is written on C++ and hence this limitation is not applicable for the original function.   We can simply pass the parameter as positional argument as given above.  Another option is to explicitly pass lambda specified by a dictionary.  metapy.index.JelinekMercer(\*\*{'lambda': 0.75}) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just pass the value, like mentioned below.  metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lamda is a key word for a kind of function also called an anonymous function

Currently, the column is set to be protected (will it be automatically updated once I submitted my assignment?)   Thank you in advance REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I do not believe you have to add the relevant counts for your query to the excel sheet. Column C in the excel sheet is to track the number of times queries used (max ~10 students may use the same query). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't have the access to update the count are we suppose to do it or do we need to let the TA update it for us? (I got a message saying that the column is protected , btw someone already updated the count for me) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: The count is calculated for you. If you add your query in that sheet you should see the count being displayed by the excel automatically (count: how many times the query has been used by other students).  If you still dont see the count, after adding your query just click on any random cell and then look at the count and it should display.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ah ok thanks, I was confused just know why the count was updated automatically after I refreshed the sheet after a while REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No need to worry about this count. It's automatically updated after each access by someone REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There is no need to calculate yourself. You just need to input your query selection and the count will be auto updated.   The execl will not be updated after your submission, and you have to do that mannually  
THREAD: An intuitive introduction to KL-Divergence(week5) KL-Divergence and cross entropy are mentioned in Week5. I haven't heard of these terms and formula before, so I spent hours digging into this.  From Wikipedia, I learned that KL-divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution is different from a second, so we can use the formula to compare two probability distributions(e.g. predicted distribution v.s true distribution). However, I still had difficulty give a intuitive explanation to the formula. After reading several introduction, I found the following video gave me the most intuitive way to understand these terms. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8 Hope this video helps someone who are interested in the intuition of the formula like me.

THREAD: Practice Quiz 5. Q3 & Q9 I have questions about Q3 and Q9 in practice quiz 5.  Q3: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0b8ec8e2-16c5-43ab-80d1-f24c840cf46f/image.png) For some extensions of PageRank (e.g. topic-specific PageRank), don't they consider the content of the document? For example, don't topic-specific PageRank consider the content or topic of the documents?  Q9: I've read #672, but I still got a question. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/40fa2e02-badb-4189-a1f4-da970e666314/image.png)  Consider the following example. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3f33253f-a900-4cb3-b2e1-3a6aed286cce/image.png) Since d3 has no outgoing link, we assign $$\alpha_3=1$$ to $$d_3$$. For $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$, we assign $$\alpha_1=0.5, \alpha_2=0.5$$. Therefore, $$ M=\left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 & 1  & 0 \\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{matrix} \right\} ,  I=\left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3}  & \frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \end{matrix} \right\} $$  $$ A = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \alpha_1\times0 & \alpha_1\times1  & \alpha_1\times0 \\ \alpha_2\times0.5 & \alpha_2\times0 & \alpha_2\times0.5 \\ \alpha_3\times0 & \alpha_3\times0 & \alpha_3\times0 \end{matrix} \right\} +  \left\{ \begin{matrix} \alpha_1\times\frac{1}{3} & \alpha_1\times\frac{1}{3}  & \alpha_1\times\frac{1}{3} \\ \alpha_2\times\frac{1}{3} & \alpha_2\times\frac{1}{3} & \alpha_2\times\frac{1}{3} \\ \alpha_3\times\frac{1}{3} & \alpha_3\times\frac{1}{3} & \alpha_3\times\frac{1}{3} \end{matrix} \right\}= \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{6} & \frac{2}{3}  & \frac{1}{6} \\ \frac{5}{12} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{5}{12} \\ \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \end{matrix} \right\} $$ , where $$A_{ij}$$ denotes the probability of moving from $$d_i$$ to $$d_j$$. After calculating eigenvector, we can get a steady state $$= \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{5}{16}  \\ \frac{3}{8} \\ \frac{5}{16}  \end{matrix} \right\}$$. So we can see $$p^n(d_1) = p^n(d_3)$$, which is contradict to the given answer. The intuitive explanation is that $$\alpha$$ only represents how a person(document) tend to share his/her money(probability) to others. $$\alpha=0.7$$ means I always give 70% of my money to all other people(randomly jump), and give 30% of my money to my friends(outgoing link). So $$\alpha$$ only show how I tend to share my money, but not show how others tend to give me money. Thus, I don't agree on this answer.   Could someone correct me if I misunderstand something? Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Q3: Could be because "topic-specific" PageRank is an extension and not a part of the core PageRank algorithm?  Q9: A page with only incoming links has $\alpha = 1.0$ (around 15:00 minute in the Lesson 5.7 lecture here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/GUQ1Q/lesson-5-7-link-analysis-part-2 ) so the second term in the previous page in this set of lecture slides is zero (?)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For Q3, I agree with you. But for Q9, I think $$\alpha$$ has nothing to do how much probability a document can get. I've modified my post. Please feel free to discuss it further with me, thanks! 
THREAD: MP2.3 lessons learnt I would just like to share my experience with my fellow class mates for their benefit.  1) Browser : Chrome for windows (already mentioned in one of the posts before) 2) Please add your query to the sign up sheet before you attempt using the MP2.3 web based tool for search.  The sign up sheet also tells you whether your query is correct (based on how many students have used it , should not be more than 10) 3) Per the instructions , the query results only 20 documents and it actually returns 20 documents for us to review whether or not they are relevant, which is very convenient.  4) For me , all the results were highly relevant. Kudos to the folks who built this tool. 5) Mark whether documents "relevant" or "not relevant" per your analysis and  6) Voila , you are done .   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: To speed things up, if my query was "x y," I searched for x in the doc and then y.  That helped me zoom in to see if things were relevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: how is this mp2.3 graded then :P  
THREAD: Regarding Rank for MP 2.4 How is the rank calculated for MP 2.4 ? From the ranking, looks like it is based on first column (NDCG@10 on APNews).   Should the rank be based on Overall Score ?  Rank in the leader board is  based on NDCG@10 of APNews and not on overall score. This doesn't seems correct.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cc8d18c9-9016-49be-a8ac-e53ccd2ab34c/image.png)   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Please refer to bottom of this page - https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As per the instructions the rank should be based on Overall score. However rank in leader board is not matching  the instructions. There are lot of submissions with higher ranks even if the overall score is below the baseline.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There is another question. I guess it loosely talks about this point - #884  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The rank is based on the overall score, but it uses a percentage of each document:  10% = APNews 30% = Cranfield  60% = Faculty  Each NDCG@10.

However overall score is not used for leader board ranking, instead only AP news score is used for ranking. Higher AP news score has higher rank. For example, overall score of 0.53 is at rank 6 where as 0.70 is at rank 12. This does not make sense. As per instructions rank should have been based on overall score. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess there seems to be a bug ranking is showing up based on AP News score only.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Agree,. This doesn't appears as true ranking system as it should be based on overall score and success attempts only. The current view appears to be based only on APNews Score. I already sent a private post to the Instructors and TAs letting them know about this. I can update here once I get a response from them.  
THREAD: New Late Quiz Penalty Policy Hi all, The late Quiz penalty has been changed to accommodate more flexibility: Quizzes will no longer have a 100% penalty for late submissions. Instead, **5% will be deducted each day after the deadline**. These deductions will continue until the cumulative penalty is 100% (20 days after the deadline). After which the deductions stop; meaning you will not have "negative" grade for any quiz.  If you have submitted a late quiz and don't automatically see these changes reflected in your grades, please post either an anonymous followup here, or a separate private question. Include information about which Quizzes you need the grades adjusted for.  
THREAD: Credit for MP 2.4 I completed MP 2.4 and got a score of 1 i.e. 100% in coursera. But as my ranking in the leaderboard was low, I kept on trying various values.  Now my ranking is high but the baseline score has become 0. I still see 100% credit in coursera. Does that mean I will get full credit?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 100% means full credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Will I extra credit also as my rank is in top 50 but the baseline score is 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you have full credit.  im not sure if its the same for this class, but Coursera takes in the highest score from all the submissions.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Will I extra credit also as my rank is in top 50 but the baseline score is 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You will likely not be considered for the extra credit calculation though, so be mindful of that if you're trying to get in the top 50 with a score of "1". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If your coursera grade section shows 100% you already got the credit.   For extra credit which I think they will calculate and end of hard deadline, only the top 50 ranked candidate with 1 as score will be eligible for the extra credit.   So for extra credit success 1 along with top 50, both are required.

THREAD: MP2.4 Task What exactly are we supposed to do in MP2.4 to get the baseline grade? The readme makes little sense to me. Are we supposed to just do MP2.2 again? Idk what is needed to get the baseline score. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You have to modify load_ranker function and select any ranker with appropriate parameter so as to ensure that your ranker performs most efficiently. The ranker that performs as per baseline will get 100%. In a way it is similar to 2.2 but additionally you have to ensure that you meet the baseline at least to get 100%.  The ranker that performs best as per leaderboard gets 5 points extra credit. Top 50 students get extra credit as per the following formula: max(0, 5-(Rank-1)/10) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So do we need to use cfg_file at all? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Few more discussions in these two threads  #856 #483 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: when you are testing on local machine you will have access to cranfield dataset, config file can handle this. But, other data sets like AP news is not available to us. When you submit your code in the grader it should automatically take other datasets into consideration. This also makes the assignment challenging because our optimized ranker should perform well over unseen dataset too.  This is what I have understood from readme, though I have not yet completed the assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: All the scores shown in the livedatalab should be above a threshold value. That will give you 100%. Anything above that will increase your ranking and will get you extra credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't change any code except under the load_ranker function and was able to get full credit. One thing that might be helpful is to try a bunch of different ranking functions/parameters and run your code locally, so you can at least see the NDCG on the cranfield dataset (this was more helpful imo than blindly submitting each change to the leaderboard). 
THREAD: Quiz Review  Is there a way to review the selected correct answers in the past real(non-practice) quiz to review for the exams? (Currently it only shows Correct/Incorrect for me without showing the selected answer)  Thank you in advance REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For some reason they aren't allowing this. Also discussed in #841   One idea that came out in that post is to take a screenshot before submission for future reference. During office hours we can request Instructors/TAs to let the students able to see their quiz responses in Quiz feedback for Graded quizzes (just like practice quizzes).  Unlike the graded quiz, Practice quiz questions and answers are always  available for review.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It seems like screenshots are the way to go for now REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the future, you could take screen shots of the questions with the answers before submitting the quiz and refer them.

THREAD: KL Model Clarification Hi,  I'm a little bit confused by the difference between the query likelihood model and the KL model. c(w, q) is counting the word in the query that matches the words in the document, whereas, the $$p(w| \^{\theta_q})$$ is the probability of the words match in the query?  Can someone please clarify this for me?   Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You can have a look at appendix **C.3** of the book. A simple Query Model $$p(w|\hat{\theta}_Q)=\frac{c(w, q)}{|q|}$$. So a simple Query Model could be similar to $$c(w, q)$$. But when it becomes a probability distribution, we can do something interesting with it. There are more explanations in appendix C.x that you can have a look. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The two are comparable, except the c value measures the occurrence frequency of a given word whereas the p value measures its probability 
THREAD: Late Policy for Submitting Partially Completed Assignments I was wondering how the late penalty is calculated if you partially complete an MP before the deadline, but complete it afterward. In particular, does the 50% penalty mean it is the maximum score that one can obtain if the assignment is submitted late or it is 50% of whatever points you accumulate after the deadline?  For instance, I completed the first part of MP2.2 and got a 70%, but I was not able to complete the second part before the deadline. If I were to complete it, would my score be 70%, 85%, or something else? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Technically you should get 70 on the submission you already submitted prior the due date... and 50% on the remaining 30 as it is past due date but before the hard deadline... which would total to 85. (100% of 70 + 50% of 30)   But I would recommend dont submit it yet unless you get a confirmation from the Instructors and TAs on that. Because if the math is wrong on the auto grader it might give you 50 (50% off 100) considering late submission for the entire work and not on just the remaining work..    I think you should send Instructors and TAs a private post asap explaining your situation and see what they say.  Also not sure in this course if the MP auto grader let you keep the best score or only the latest score. It should keep the best score (and not latest score) but I am not confident on that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Ideally, credit should be given for the parts based on when they were first submitted. Let's hope that that's the case. 
THREAD: Confirming credit for MP2.3 I completed MP2.3 and wanted to confirm that I should not see any "instant" grading/credit in Coursera like we did with the previous MPs?  If not, will credit show up in Coursera before the MP deadline? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For MP2.3 I got the grade instant.   You can check the Grades section if you have received grade or not (not sure if you have already checked that).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/854c0a3f-ebdd-4733-91a3-076fcae24999/image.png)  The actual submission page wont show any grade for MP2.3.

THREAD: MP2.3 Relevance Rubric? I followed the guidelines and got 20 texts under "text mining". However, I carefully read through the texts and find out that they are all faculty pages. I don't think faculty information page  including the word text mining answers any question related to text mining. Thus, I marked them not relevant. Is that ok? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you see they are contextually irrelevant for the purpose, you can mark the document as not relevant.    However, you might lose the information for faculty specialized in text mining etc. Ultimately, the whole collection is about the faculty and their corresponding data. Also the documents are hybrid in nature which means they came from multiple sources (multiple student uploads) and content style might not be uniform. So I took those factors in account to make best judgement while marking a document irrelevant.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It's your choice - you decide what is relevant for your search terms although there is a ground truth. Perhaps this exercise is similar to the use of Captcha to label items in pictures REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it depends on your personaly judegment. It can involve keyword and symmantic meaning or anything underlying the text

I got to the MP2.4 leaderboard last week, and I can get to other projects' leaderboards.  Is anyone else having the same issue? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Followed your steps and was able to see the MP2.4 leaderboard without any re-sign or any redirection.   Maybe delete browser cookies and/or close browser (sessions/tabs/windows) and try again ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try with another browser and another machine , are you still getting the problem ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's fine now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's fine now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I still can't get my MP scores on Coursera - LiveDataLab has everything. I followed all the suggested instructions. 
THREAD: MP2.2 Success on LiveData on time but graded late on Coursera I recently found out that my MP2.2 submission was not graded on Coursera while I finished it on time (9/19) assuming that it would be graded automatically.  Unfortunately, it did not happen that I figured out that I had to click the "Open Tool" to navigate to LiveDataLab to sync my submission/grade with Coursera. So, I made a new commit then got it graded but Coursera says 50% late penalty is applied (9/21, today).  This is a bit frustrating but I only wonder how would the grade be in this case? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since you have your successful commit by the due date with score 1 at leaderboard, see if you can send a private post to the Instructors and TAs explaining your situation.  They can help you to get back your 100% credit.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Once you got a score = 1 in livelab, before deadline, it should be fine for you. Send a msg to TA.  I think the professor will not use the final data from Coursera.  
THREAD: MP3 formula I'm trying to understand the E-step that needs to be implemented in MP3.   Given that:  *"The original PLSA model does not contain a background model. This MP also is based on the original PLSA model, you do not have to worry about the background model."*   Is it safe to assume that the formula here is the top one presented on this slide?   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b3738eba-0ce0-4315-b169-922f3ad0ada0/image.png)  Thanks for your time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Hi,  Yes, you basically need to implement the first formula for the E-step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you 
THREAD: MP2.4  The task asks us to do an evaluation based on NDCG. So we need a set of score results with gained levels, here is an example:     ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6eea0381-0a8a-4862-bbf8-30c742ca21d0/image.png)  There are two ways I can come up with:  1. Using 'cranfield-qrels.txt' directly and do an evaluation based on this text because I believe the 3th column of this text is the gained level that we need to know. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/98768667-999c-407c-90d8-9d4b44bc9568/image.png)  2. Another way is to use 'result scores (framed with green rectangle),' and we need to identify ranges of different levels. After giving the 'result' a level, we could do NDCG evaluation then.    ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0139617b-c251-443d-9422-13ec52d72f97/image.png)  Confused about this part. Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The datasets are used via the config.toml file. So I dont think we need to do anything to manually choose them as such...Even the faculty and apnews datasets are actually loaded in system but not shown to you. So I think the relevance judgements for those are also set in hidden config that is not exposed to us. We just need to loop through these datasets via config and generate our results. Not sure if this answers your question... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Is the APNews data set available anywhere that we have access to? What kind of data is 'AP News'? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Two of the three data sets are not provided to us, so we pretty much have to "guess" how the algorithm we implement will handle them. It's a weird approach and I think I'd have a much better understanding of the assignment and the algorithm implementation if we were able to actually see the impact the changes we're making have on the data sets. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The ask is to select a appropriate ranker in meta library in `load_ranker()` and tweak the parameters to achieve best results. You can only see the Cranfield dataset but when you submit the autograder will validate the ranker also on APNews and Faculty dataset which is visible only to the autograder.  However, they also mentioned you can write your own ranker function.  There is no limit an submission attempts to test your score and improve the rankers or the parameters based on sbumission results that you can see in the MP2.4 leaderboard.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your response. So, we also need to use loop to find the best (or good) parameters, like in MP2.2?  Best, ZiZi REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No looping here might not work perfectly because they will call your `load_ranker()` for the hidden datasets (APNews and Faculty).  You can run the looping locally to find the best parameters for cranfield dataset in your local machine. But keep in mind the autograder will test the parameters for all three datasets and not just cranfield. So there is bit manual work involved but you have got unlimited attempts too. :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Got you. 100% of clear now. Thank you again.  ZiZi

THREAD: Quiz 4 Penalty Before Hard Deadline Hello! I did not take Quiz 4 until shortly after the deadline last night/early this morning.   Based on my understanding of the course policies and #219, I believe that until the hard deadline in Week 7 we should still receive full credit for the quiz; however Coursera is showing a 100% penalty on the score.   I did not see this penalty on a previous quiz I took after the recommended deadline. Did I misunderstand the policy or will this not be reflected in Coursera's gradebook for Quiz 4? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Few other students experienced the same issue. As per the course policy quizzes Week1-7 need to be completed by Week7 for full credit. So your understanding is correct.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/9857937f-510c-4bcb-96c2-a43f45b3e1aa/image.png)    You should receive full credit for the quiz.

THREAD: avg_p = ev.avg_p(results, query_start + query_num, top_k) Could anyone explain a little bit on **"query_start + query_num"**?  What does it do here? Just for counting?  Thanks for any sharings.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Seems like something which can be used in case we want to consider only selective queries from the query_file (going by enumerate) - in our case, I think we are considering all of the queries. query_num could be a selector, while query_start is just to position it relatively. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The query_start is just the position where the program starts to evaluate the score. The query num is the length of content it should evaluate. In MP2.2, I don't think we have to be worried about these two variables too much (just leave them). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The labels are descriptive - i.e., 'query_start' is where the query starts the process and it proceeds until 'query_num' is reached.

THREAD: MP2.2 Lost on how/what to write to bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt files ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/00491b9d-55d4-4201-9452-316ec9b34dab/image.png)  I've read the instructions for Statistical significance testing a bunch of times and checked a ton of Campuswire questions, but I'm still really lost as to how I'm supposed to go about accomplishing anything in this section.  - I don't understand how by modifying the code in "Varying a parameter" section, you can create a file with average precision data. I think they're referring to this code:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/10c16c7d-2567-4783-8d43-12753146e4f0/image.png)  But it says this code is included in search_eval.py, and I only found similar-looking-but-different code:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b292aaa5-7f89-405c-8ae4-1480e39c6091/image.png)  Also, I thought we were supposed to be implementing the "ranker" line in load_ranker() and calling upon the load_ranker() to obtain the ranker, but that's not what's happening in the top code example.  Also, since we're supposed to be writing to both bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt files, I'm confused as to whether we're supposed to include code for both of them and run them at the same time, or run each separately and replace the file names & rankers?  If I am supposed to use the code in the top picture, where am I supposed to put that code? Am I supposed to replace the bottom picture's code with the top picture's code, or do I keep the code in the bottom picture? Do I put it somewhere separately, and if so, which function in search_eval.py do I put it in? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There are 2 ways of doing that... Way 1 - For each BM25 (or you can select any other ranker) and the InL2 ranker, Print the AVG_P (ONLY the value)  for each query and then copy paste (all the 225 lines) in to the respective .txt files.  Way 2: use the pythonic way and write the AVG_P (per line) into file using file writer.  Once you have those 2 files <selectedRanker>.txt and Inl2.txt Then you can  create a separate script to calculate the p-value.  Let me know if you need further explaination...  I have also detailed out the entire assignment steps over here in this Post... take a look..  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I can tell you're frustrating. After you've gotten the value, create a new text file that only contains the average precision score for each of InL2 and Bm25 test result. Name them respectively.  Load them into np.array. Performance this [function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) and the answer is what you need at the end. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried doing Way 1 just now, copying the values from the terminal by doing Contrl+Shift+C, but when I paste it into the .txt file, it all goes onto line 1, and so I'd have to manually separate line by line. Is this correct?  Way 2 is where I have questions, because I don't understand how I'm supposed to do that at all. You can see my post for the questions I have regarding file writing.  I did see your CampusWire post previously, but I feel like I'm still very lost as to how to accomplish anything. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, but I still don't understand how I'm supposed to achieve any of this, which is why I asked the questions above in the original post. I know I'm supposed to create a new text file that only contains the average precision score for each of InL2 and Bm25 test result (it said that in the instructions), but I'm very unclear as to how I'm supposed to do that, which is why I asked all those questions. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nvm, I tried Control+C instead and it pasted into 225 lines instead of 1. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: First try to PUSH and submit just the Ranker function. and get that 70% mark. that will tell you that your ranker is correct. Then move to the PART 2 of the assignment (the p-value) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have already submitted/pushed the Ranker function for the 70%, so that's why I'm working on Part 2 (the significance testing), and my questions are about Part 2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Screenshot: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e138ebe4-3e60-43eb-9154-a7b730454aea/image.png) You edit score function and and make Vary Parameter code works. Then you get the screenshot picture that contains numbers you need and adding them into those files.  You get two sets of answers by running eval.py and Varying Parameter code respectively. Then you put them into those two new txt files respectively.  Upvote if helpful. good luck REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to get this to work, thanks for the help! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: oh... Ok.. Thats great !! I saw couple of students doing all in one shot and then they were facing the error.. So thought of checking that first.. Let me know if you were able to get it going !! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to complete the assignment. Thanks for the help! :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the loop that was provided in the code, there is a line that prints the MAP to command line. Right below that line, you can also write the MAP to a txt file.  f = open ("file_name.txt", "w") -> w will overwrite the contents of the file - do this outside the loop  In the for loop: f.write(str(MAP_variable) + "\n")  f.close() -> outside the for loop  At a macro level, you can do this process twice to generate the LnL2 and BM25.  First time you modify the code to use BM25 and write the MAP score on each line of a txt file. Second time you modify the code to use your ranker implementation of lnL2 AND modify the file open code to use the new file name for lnL2. Then execute the script a second time. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just a minor note to make that more concise, we can use `with` to avoid having to manually close `f.close()` (similar to Java's "try with resource").  The code we were provided already has a `with` statement for the `query_file`, but we can add a second file to that line with a `,`.  Resulting in:  `with open(query_path) as query_file, open('file_name.txt', 'w') as f:`

That `scipy` code is considered a test code. Keep the file `significance.txt` file and that should be it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You need not post the scipy bit to github. You can write the logic for the significance test outside of the main script. This way you're not adding extra dependencies. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: For generating the significance.txt, create a separate python script. Then you can either keep it or ignore in the git versioning. Even if you push it, the grader will still accept it. Keep the PART 1 and PART 2 code separate. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it's past the assignment's due date now, but I handled this by moving the all the code that uses scripy **including the import statement** to the very bottom of the .py file. That way the grader application is able to run everything that matters and, even though it technically errors once it reaches the import at the bottom, it doesn't matter because it's already done its job.  Alternatively, you could have wrapped the scripy stuff in a `try`.

You may like to check your InL2 function/object. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm curious to know how my function is being assessed.   Knowing how unit tests are written, I can't imagine how the internal InL2 function is being tested. It seems more likely that the data coming out of the function should be evaluated? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: check whether you are using correct sd.* variables in score_one for each of the variable in the formula.  Second part of MP just checks whether significance.txt has a valid value within a given range. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have used math.log2 it will always be incorrect. Try changing it to math.log(cyz,2)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess it mainly tests your inl2.avg_p.txt instead of the function. So a correct score_one() and optimized parameter generate correct inl2.avg_p.txt.  One thing comes up to my mind is, have you revised the return part of score_one function?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am slightly closer  1. Despite implementing all the code in the jupyter notebook, I forgot that they are evaluating the .py file  2. I'm now getting the error  ``` ('ERROR: ', AttributeError("'module' object has no attribute 'log2'",)) ```  Despite having switched from log2 to log()  The troubleshooting continues....    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for your help... I think the issue is somewhere in my search_eval.py at this point REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Are you sure? If it is still throwing the error means you still have log2 somewhere. Try to do a command/ctrl + F and push your code again.And yes, please do not push you jupyter notebook. You would need two files at max. One would be to use scipy since live data lab basically can't import stuff and doesn't have all python libraries installed REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you were right. there was another instance of log2() in my code. full credit achieved thank you!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried to do the submission in 2 parts...  Try submitting the Part 1 code first.  i.e. do not include the Significance.txt.  And then see if you pass the 70% mark there.. If not then you have issue in your Inl2 ranker (which is likely the issue)  Try to make sure that you are using correct sd.<property> .

THREAD: Safely remove python 3.7... How could I safely uninstall Python 3.7 and safely install 3.5? Everytime I tried to create virtual env in Jupyter. There was no response whatsoever. Frustrating REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-uninstall-python/ will help. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you have python3.7 created as virtual environment... you dont have to immediately uninstall it. It wont do any harm.  Just create another virtual environment with python3.5 and keep using the python3.5 for the MPs.  That is the beauty of virtual environments. That dont interfere with each other and you can have multiple virtual environments on your system for multiple project requirements.

You mentioned that 2.7 works as well? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: seems you are already inside an virtual environment.. how have to deactivate that first (come out of it). And the create another virtual environment... python3.5 need to be separate virtual environment  Depending on what virtual environment package you using (seems you are using `venv`) follow the documentation to deactivate current virtual environment and create a new one. You should be able to create any virtual environment 2.7 or 3.5 whatever...   I use anaconda (`conda`) to manage my virtual environment. I also use pycharm.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/106  maybe this helps.  conda create -n env python=3.5 conda activate env  these commands should create and activate the python virtual env REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I suggested using pyenv to manage your python versions. It's  very handy and allows you to have multiple pythons on your computer. I have like 4 different versions for different projects. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would consider pumping the breaks on uninstall python. Occasionally, the operating system or packaged application may use it.   Consider pyenv install/uninstall instead 
THREAD: Rankers other than BM25 I chose Dirichlet Prior and mu and compared it with InL2 and got a p value < 0.05. Is this okay> Or do I need to do it with bm25? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For sake of completeness of the assignment, i would recommend to do the comparison significance with BM25. It might look for the files `bm25.avg_p.txt` and `inl2.avg_p.txt` . Since you have unlimited attempts. You can try your original route and if the grader is not happy you can switch to BM25.   The rubrics doesn't explicitly says it has to be bm25 so you might have benefit of doubt. :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did it with the other one and I named my text files completely different. I still got a 100%  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nice. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it explicitly say to compare with BM25 (initially it says to experiment with different algos but for comparison BM25 was mentioned). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nope not needed  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am curious on what basis do you say that. what I see in the git readme is:  "Use BM25 as a ranker and create a file called bm25.avg_p.txt. Then use your ranker InL2 and create a file called inl2.avg_p.txt. Each of these files is simply a list of the APs from the queries. We want to test whether the difference between your two optimized retrieval functions is statistically significant."  if the TAs/Prof said otherwise, I apologize - but I dont see where it says BM25 was optional for comparison. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: At the beginning where they asked us to use one of the other 6 ranker functions plus parameters except bm25 to sweep parameters and get the comparison done. they showed us an example with bm25 that's why. Another reason I say that is because I did not use bm25 and still got 100% REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: oh yeah thats true - I dont think it checks for BM25 (or for that matter anything else probably) - I think the only ask was to implement Ln2 and provide significance.txt

THREAD: MP 2.2 bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt file contents Should the above files just contain the per query average or the MAP as well? For example , there are 225 queries , hence the files should also contain 225 lines ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: they should just contain average precision not MAP REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes only the `avg_p` values and just the values (with no text). No MAP. And nothing else.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, 1 line per query with the average value only. Therefore, both files should have 225 lines. 
THREAD: MP2.2 InL2 Variables This is a dumb question, so I apologize:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/63434132-6370-4b42-a338-7ccff89c6013/image.png)  For the InL2 formula, I'm supposed to be coding in a formula with the following variables. However, I'm very lost as to how I'm supposed to retrieve the values for these variables and how to combine them into the formula. Here's my thought process: - Q = query = metapy.index.Document() - D = document = IDK, I thought the metapy.index.Document() command would retrieve the document, but that seems to retrieve the query, and I couldn't find any other information on how to retrieve the current document in any of the other functions/files. - t = term = IDK, I see "term_id t_id" and "uint64_t total_terms" in score_data.h, but I haven't found any other information regarding how to find terms. - N = the total number of documents in corpus C = " uint64_t num_docs" in score_data.h? I'm not sure how I would implement that in search_eval.py though. - avgdl = Average document length = "float avg_dl" in score_data.h? I'm again not sure how I would implement that in search_eval.py though. - c > 0 = is a parameter = I have no idea where to even start with defining this variable in search_eval.py.  Additionally, I'm confused as to how I can use Sigma or (log 2). Am I supposed to be using built-into-the-project functions for this? Am I supposed to be using some math functions that come with Python? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I haven't pulled off the implementation yet, either but the log2 function is in the python math library  I've understood c(t,Q) to be the equivalent of "number of times term appears in Query" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In score_one you do not have to care about SUM. This is done outside the function and you do not have to worry about that.  c can be 1,2,3,4..... etc.  In score_one just implement the formula by ensuring that you are using correct sd.* variable for each.   In load_ranker just call your InL2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Below posts should answer most of your questions.  #782 #788  Search more in campuswire and you will plenty of reference.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: also this part:  *c > 0 = is a parameter = I have no idea where to even start with defining this variable in search_eval.py.*  This is a parameter already set up for you in the part of the class that you don't need to touch. It is defaulted at c=1, and to reference it in your formula you just call  ``` self.param ```

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did submit and got a 1 but I'm pretty sure it's just checking p <.05 because everyone will have different ones  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: any value less than 0.05 means that there is significant difference between InL2 and BM25. value > 0.05 means there is no significant difference. Remember BM25 is state of art and very efficient. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You got 1 already, so it is fine.

Note the "args" parameter: ```     "configurations": [         {             "name": "Python: Current File",             "type": "python",             "request": "launch",             "program": "${file}",             "console": "integratedTerminal",             "args":["config.toml"],         }     ] ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/9240b5db-a0d3-4bd7-9d4a-c15ae28076a4/image.png)  nothing to do with python version right REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe you still have to comment the previous three lines .. see how i commented above.

THREAD: Suggestion for the deadline of MPs Hi  This question is more for Professor and TAs. My understanding is that we have until Week 7 for first 7 quizzes to complete and no penalty before that. But for MPs we lose points if we don't meet the first deadline.  All the deadlines of the MPs are the same week as the lectures. I think at least one extra week make more sense. This MS program is for people that have potentially other engagements and juggle many things and having the deadline on the same week as lecture is not really goes with that. As a suggestion can you at least give one week extra after the lecture week for MPs? Thank you REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thanks for the information that there is no late penalty for quizzes. I was not aware of that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Personally, I find the deadlines and penalty policy of this course quite generous when compared to other courses.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: what other courses did you have? I am curious. It is my last semester and I had the following : 1- Data Cleaning 2- Data Viz 3- Scientific Viz 4- Data Curation 5- IoT  6- DLH  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I actually wasn't aware of this and thought the hard deadline rule applies to both quizzes and MPs. I intentionally didn't submit last week's MP thinking I still have time. Would love if we can get extension and thanks for posting otherwise I would have missed other submissions.  Edit: I just checked the course deadlines page and only the late policy section points to this. The table above for the dates doesn't indicate this.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yup! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It's not the absolute value. It's the size of the set REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It can be a little confusing because the vertical bar, |x|, is used differently in different contexts, but it seems like it is used as 'length of' here and in the lectures regarding probabilistic models.

THREAD: What is "c(t,C)" What is c(t,C) in the sd library? Is it sd.total_terms? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Its the collection term count. (HINT: corpus == collection ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: c(t,C) represents the total count of (i.e., the number of times) term t in corpus C REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Any c() you encounter, it means the frequency of the term, or count of the term or no of times the terms appears.  So. c(t, C) would mean number of times term appears in corpus

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: lower case c is a parameter you would pass to your function  and for other 2 you are correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi, The singular "c" is a separate parameter (which may vary as c > 0). (HINT: you will need to vary this to get the maximum MAP - Mean Average Precision out of your final InL2 ranker function.)  the rest c() are the various COUNTS of Term for Query or Document or Corpus (or Collections).  They are also referred as Query term count, etc.. (HINT: check the score data link)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: N is also total number of doc in corpus C. So N equals to c(t,D)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do you assign c in the score function? If I simply put c>0, the error will be "c is not defined". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No, N would be sd.num_docs I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The c is the self.param in the constructor. that's what you need to use. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: c is something to be mapped with self.param on your code. You would get your best results by changing the parameter which essentially means by tweaking the value of c.   C() (for e.g. c(t, Q), c(t, D) etc.) on the other hand are the calculated values that you will get from the score_data. You can't change the values of c().    
THREAD: InL2 not implemented correctly Hi, I do think I have implemented score_one correctly. I've got Mean average precision: 0.2396277693793568 and the p-value is 0.03.  Really confused about what is going wrong, thanks ahead for any help! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: with this value of MAP, p value seems to be incorrect. How did you calculate p value. Did you use scipy? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I use Rstudio to compute p-value which is 0.03487. I actually get the 0.3 points for part2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did it come as 0.03 or did you truncate it to 0.03? Generally it is a big floating number. Were you able to tweak your parameter to maximize your MAP ?  You have to explore with different values in the parameter to see which one is generating the best value for you.   Classmates have done looping, hit and trial method etc to get the desired results.    These posts can also be relevant for you #664 #480 #667  To calculate the p-value see if you can use python and does that make any difference. Although difference should be negligible if you are doing right using R or Python provided if it is being done the right way.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My problem is using math.log incorrectly, just in case anybody needs this info. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I got the similar numbers. How did you know your implementation is not correct? Did you get some errors in the output? You may put some pictures here.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also got the same error initially even though I thought what I did was correct. Try debugging your formula you implemented for inl2. Mine was related to syntax for math.log(xyz,2) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My error is discovering in the error message on livedata saying math did not have log2.

Is the parameter **sd** in *score_one(self, sd)* the ***idx** (idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index(cfg)*? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For question 2: c() is a count function, so c(t, Q) is the total occurrences of the term t in the query Q. Same idea for the rest of the c() listed in question 3.   the values can be obtained by using sd.X where X is the attribute found in this file (refer to the comment above the line): https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/score_data.h  EDIT: remember you are only working on one term at a time. the ranker formula should be written as such and the rest of the provided code performs the iterations so that all the terms are passed through  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please find the inline answers to the best of my knowledge:  Does "term" mean every single word except stop words in query and doc?  ---> Term and word are synonyms here, including Stop words as user might use stop words as well in the query. The stop words are handled by the model separately (HINT: stopword.txt).  Does c(t, Q) mean how many times t(this term) show up in Q? ----> Count of each terms in the Query  How to obtain these three values? Is there a name for that approach. ---> The Score_data or sd is used to obtain these values  (HINT: sd.<property>).

Is the parameter sd in score_one(self, sd) the idx (idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index(cfg)?  ---> No, sd or Score data is a separate attribute which comes along with metapy library.) it can be accessed using sd.<property>.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Term means each word in the query.  c() means frequency which is count or number of times that term appeared.  c(t, Q) --> Number of times the term appears in the query c(t, D) --> Number of times the term appears in the current doc c(t, C) --> Number of times the term appears in corpus  `sd` parameter in `score_one()` is the score_data object from where you can access the corresponding variables for c(t, Q), c(t, C) etc. The content of `score_data` object can be found here: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/score_data.h. Use those variables to replace your c(t, C), C(t, Q) etc. in the formula. Try to find if you find a variable that gives you c(t, Q) in the score_data object. See the comment for each variable in the score_data object and you will find a match. Once you find a match you can access them in your code as `sd.<variable>`.  Good luck

THREAD: MP2.2 Also not sure how to start Like #768, I have also read the README multiple times, and I've read a lot of the CampusWire questions & answers, but I'm still confused.  First, I'm having trouble installing metapy. When I try to install metapy on the PyCharm terminal in my MP2.2_private folder, I get the following errors:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/dd9d7110-5719-4aba-be36-48b515ffa7a5/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/82baad96-dfde-456f-857e-d436a30af224/image.png)  I've looked at #750, the linked https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32680081/importerror-after-successful-pip-installation, and several other CampusWire questions, but I still haven't made progress in installing metapy yet. So when I try to run search_eval.py, I get this roadblock:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fe8f7196-fb9b-42f2-9711-5402b2a44a40/image.png)  I also have some dumb questions:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f1ee7ecc-7d22-458f-960e-69954933858e/image.png)  There's a lot of codeblocks in the beginning of the README, and I'm confused as to where to paste these codeblocks. Am I supposed to paste them into search_eval.py? Am I supposed to create a new Python file and paste the code in there? Am I supposed to do them on the Anaconda or Pycharm terminal? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I was having the same issue before. I solved it by installing the Anaconda and created a virtual environment for running the scripts and commands. Here is how I do it in OSX: ``` conda create --name cs410 python=3.5 conda activate cs410 ``` And then you can try using pip to install the metapy. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also for how to start this MP, I find this post very useful. #699  I hope this can help you get started. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Regarding the metapy. I am using python 2.7 and pip install. Others are using conda, but python2.7 has worked for me like charm.  If you resolve this metapy error. I have tried to suggest few steps (without stating the obvious answer). Please take a look and let me know if you still have issues.  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Create a virtual environment (either python 2.7 or python 3.5). Similarly how you did your MP1. If you have the environment of MP1, you can use the same environment.   Regarding the assignment execution, first clone the repo following the MP setup instructions on week1 (like how you did MP1/MP2.1).   Then run the program on your environment as  ``` python search_eval config.toml ``` or  ``` python3 search_eval config.toml ``` depending what python you are using.  And then modify the `score_one()` function to implement InL2 formula. No need to worry about the summation portion. It will be taken care of by the program automatically. And also modify `load_ranker()` to call `InL2Ranker` instance. Once you achieve this, follow the instruction on `Varying InL2’s parameter` and `Statistical significance testing` for final requirements for grading.  Good luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I looked at #699 previously, but I still feel like it didn't help me at all (I don't feel like I'm at the same part of the project as 699 was).   How do you create the environment in Anaconda again? Am I supposed to be running the Anaconda terminal in the MP2.2_private folder? Can I just create a random new one to run the commands? Can I just use the one I used for MP1? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How did you use Python 2.7? I checked my Python version on Pycharm and it said it was 3.8. I think I can create a Python 2.7 environment using Anaconda, but I do not really know how I would exactly go about accomplishing that. Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't recall exactly how I created the virtual environment in MP1 (I think I used Anaconda? Or is the virtual environment supposed to be Pycharm? Or can the virtual environment be both?)  I did clone MP2.2 already into the MP2.2_private folder, and as shown in the screenshots in the post, I've ran both "python search_eval config.toml" and "python3 search_eval config.toml", but the python3 one didn't work and the python one is getting me the error shown in the screenshot.  I'm still not quite clear about what modifying the score_one() function means. In search_eval.py, it says in the comments section for score_one() that "You need to override this function to return a score for a single term", so do I modify the existing score_one() in search_eval.py? Or do I override the score_one() elsewhere separately in search_eval.py and not touch the original score_one()? Or do I create a new Python file to write the code where I override/modify score_one()? The same questions for load_ranker() as well.  Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for answering. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: if you know how to use a venv (virtual environment) then you can have a separate python 2.7 installation. But if not, then you can always install a Python 2.7 version (separate from conda). That's what I did. Below is the python org link.   https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/  Once done, use pip install to install metapy under python 2.7. and use python instead of python3 to execute the scripts for all the MPs REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've tried installing Python for MP1 and worked on it extensively with someone else (I believe they were a TA), and ultimately we couldn't figure it out, installing Python did not work for my PC for some reason. Thanks for answering though. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Can you try using the below command?  pip install metapy==0.2.13 pytoml  The python 2.7 is not compatible with the default (recent) version of metapy. So I had to install an older version. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have used anaconda in MP1.  Try this and this should work ``` conda env list ``` If it lists the environment, the using the below command you can switch to your desired environment ``` conda activate <env from the above list> ```  you can also see you current python version using  ``` python --version python3 --version ``` whatever you are using it should be 2.7 or 3.5 for your MP2.2  Forget about override the function. Just comment the existing return and implement the formula in that function and return the new result. That's it.      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried using that command, but it got me the same errors in red as the red errors that are in my first two screenshots of the post. Didn't seem to work, unfortunately. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to switch to my desired environment on Anaconda, so thanks for the tips! I was also able to see my current Python version (3.5.6).  I've already cloned my MP2.2 on PyCharm, though, so I'm worried that I might run into duplicate problems if I clone MP2.2 again (this time on the Anaconda terminal). Should I clone MP2.2 again? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I met the similar question at the beginning of this class. What I did:  1. Download 'Anaconda'  2. Open 'Anaconda Prompt' and create a  new environment with python = 3.7 by:            ```conda create -n myenv python=3.7``` note: ```myenv ``` is the file's name (e.g. mine is python3.7) 3. Activate python3.7 with:      ``` conda activate python3.7``` 4. install libs by pip:    ``` pip install metapy pytoml``` 5. Open VSCode and select the python version I created (I only use VSCode, so not sure about other tools): ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/74bc3e63-14cd-47c9-a112-8aef49d2c136/image.png) So far so good. Hope it works for you. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: from your conda python environment.... you can go to any location and run the program so yes, you can use your existing clone. Just go to that directory and run ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` and you should see the output.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This worked, thanks!

THREAD: MP 2.2 Invalid File Error When running this code, I am getting an invalid file error: idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index('C:/Users/***/Desktop/CS 410/MP2.2_private/config.toml') This is the error: invalid file for list error  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I was having the same issue. Make sure your script and config.toml file are located in the same folder & that you are executing from there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The original program used `config.toml` as the argument. you can keep that portion as is and if using python command line just the run the program as  ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` That would be it.   But if using jupyter notebook, then probably mention the file inside the code.

THREAD: How to write to significance.txt Hi.  For the second part of the MP, I'm not sure how to put the p value into the significance.txt. Do we still have to make the two file, bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt? I think I understand how to use the scipy.stats.ttest_rel function but just not sure how to make the files. And also I'm having errors with sys.exit(1). Is that because I haven't finished load_ranker or am I not suppose to run the file in jupyter lab. Thanks.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try incorporating the parameter here when running the script. **python search_eval.py config.toml** REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: All u need to do is write to a file when u calculate the avg_p value, so place a code which writes the contents to the file.  Something like:  ```  print('Running queries')     with open("bm25.avg_p.txt","w") as f:                 ...........other code ...........                 f.write(str(avg_p)+"\n")     print("Closing file") ```  change the file name when u run the Iln2 ranking function code.  Once you have both files, run code separately that generates float arrays and use scipy.stats.ttest_rel for generating the p value. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: first you need to tackle the load_ranker function. If you are yet to implement the InL2 ranker, then lets do that 1st.  I have tried to explain the steps to someone on this POST.  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you have to create both the files.  a. `bm25.avg_p.txt` containing all the avg_p values for bm25 algo b. `inl2.avg_p.txt` containing all the avg_p values for inl2 algo  You can create these two files while recording the p values in the program itself. There are many ways to write data in file. I am sure you will figure that out.    Once you create these files, the README explains different approaches using R or using python to use the data from both files  to generate the `significance.txt` file. Remember to write only the floating value in the  ``significance.txt` file and no scientific notation value. Good luck.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm getting the results in my terminal but when I try to write to the files, only the last avg_p is there. I wasn't able to write to a new line each time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was super helpful, thank you!

Same thing runs fluently on a cloud VM with very low resource (614MB RAM, 10GB HDD), so I am continuing the work there. Probably something else is wrong with my system settings. Thanks for the reply. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Change your working directory to point to the folder where config.toml is present REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Working directory was right and the commands were run from the folder where the `config.toml` file was present. I did try with a python script in the same directory too, but same thing happened.  It's working in same setup on a Cloud VM with limited resource. I am going to use that for solving this MP, and may be debug the system issue later. Thanks for the response though.

THREAD: MP2.2 don't know where to start I have read the README multiple times but I do not know where to start and what to do. I know I need to populate the functions score_one and load_ranker but what do does functions mean? What am I supposed to implement? I am having a hard time starting the MP REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Start by implementing the given InL2 equation in the score_one function.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you have cloned the Repo. I would suggest 1st run the search_eval.py with an argument config.toml. This will give you an idea what it is currently doing.  As you might have read that this assignment needs 2 parts to submit.  PART 1: The initial code implements one of the ranking functions - without a parameter. this code is implemented using the imported metapy library (refer the load_ranker function)  Now about the InL2 function and score and the whole Readme function.  if you have gone through the given images - ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b7d68c07-adeb-4e19-85cb-a11229586a5e/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fb6d2e03-59ec-49e1-87da-6f1faeb9b9ef/image.png)  then you just need to implement (convert) the formula inside the SUMMATION into code (HINT: you would need math.log). The rest of the python code (already given) takes care of the summation for you.  Now to convert the 2 above functions. you need to use SOURCE_DATA or sd library (also part of metapy, already imported). To view what sd library holds, there is a link given. Follow that for to look up the various properties given in it.  HINT: sd.<property> will give you the required values of the various properties.   PART 2: Let me know once you complete the PART 1, I will explain the Part 2.   Let me know in case of any issues REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #680  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Implement the score function (test it in another notebook) - only the part *inside* the summation. 2. Run the script (which prints a list of average precision) - once for a standard ranker, once for your inl2 ranker - append these values in lists and run the scipy function for statistical inference. Paste p value in *significance.txt* REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Part 2: This step is really very trivial but tricky. It needs to be done by creating a separate .py file and using scipy library.  To start with, write the avg precisions from InL2 and another selected (any one of the 5-6 ranker fundtions), into a text file (HINT: newline separated). Then use those 2 text files and read them in THAT scipy script as lists. (HINT: str to float).  There is link provided in the Readme for the scipy usage. Make sure you read that.  Let me know if that takes you somewhere. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Kushagra, how would I do c(t,D) and c(t,Q)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Vedant, c(t,D) is Document term count i.e. number of times a term appears in the document. c(t,Q) - is the number of times a term appears in the query.  You should find these description in the sd link.  (HINT: sd.<property>) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, Thank you! I understood it much better :) Thanks again for your help!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is 'c' the param described in the constructor of the class? and what is c(t,C)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes.. the "c" is the "some_param" parameter in the constructor which is assigned to self.param)

THREAD: Statistical Significance Testing of 5% I just want to check if we are aiming for a p-value of below 5%.   According to the ReadMe, if we are below 5%, there is a significant difference between the lists.  Are we aiming for them to be different or are we aiming for them to be the same? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is not necessary that you will get p value below 5%. This is because even BM25 function is pretty efficient.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: we aim that they are same, but if the p < 5%, we reject our assumption, so conclude that they are different. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Alternatively, try to maximize the InL2 MAP and make it as close match as it can be with BM25.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our aim is to reduce the difference between the Ln2 MAP and BM25 MAP and make them close.  Statistical test is to further ensure whether this reduction is statistically sigificant or not occured by a random chance.  A p value less than 5% means there is only less than 5% chance that the observed similarity is due to random occurence. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In a simpler terms, we want to test that whether the MAP calculated by 2 different rank functions are significantly different or not. I compared the InL2 ranker with BM25 and DirichletPrior. Below are my findings - The dirichlet vs Inl2 has a p-value = 0.39... while the BM25 vs InL2 has p-value = 0.044  This tells that the BM25 and Inl2 rankers have significant difference in their calculated Avg precisions and there is 4.4 % chance that it is due to randon fluctuations. (As We know BM25 is a pretty efficient)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: so, what does this conclude? The InL2 is better than Dirichlet as it has 4.4% vs. Dirichlet 's 39%? I wanted to understand what is the take away or 'to do next' after a significance test. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the take away here is MAP value of lnL2 is quite comparable with the output of BM25 ranker but not so with DirichletPrior.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Smaller p-values signify that the difference between the two things being compared is statistically significant.  5% is just a random threshold.

If you have the cranfield folder in your repo (MP2.2), try to run the program from your MP2.2 directory where you will have the cranfield folder.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you are supposed to run search_eval.py?

THREAD: Question on Probabilistic retrieval model General question: I understand in order to explain the model part of the course content, relevance was already given in binary number based on which probability was defined but what I don't understand is how does it work in real world. Let's say I am building a new search engine, how do I get relevance or user feedback for the documents I have stored. Also, same question for existing search engine getting millions of new documents day by day. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I wondered about this as well. Perhaps this is what is referred to as the cold start problem? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Feedback is part of Week 5, where you will probably get answers to your questions.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/200cfc5d-3d90-4e68-b10a-5339cd3ec623/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As per the content , its mainly user clicks on certain document is marked as relevant but I do not completely agree on this . It should also be the time spent on the page , for example - one a search query , I clicked one url and spend less than 5 sec - I should not consider this page as relevant but not sure why this factor is not considered here 
THREAD: Question about smoothing methods I have a general question regarding smoothing methods. In lessons 4.5 and 4.6, we talk about how we need to do smoothing so that the probabilities of words are not equal to zero, but what happens if a word in the query is not in the collection LM? Or will this not happen? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think this will never happen. The collection LM should cover all already?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have the same question. What if a query term is neither in the document nor in the collection LM? Is there an underlying assumption that the collection LM covers all the possible query terms? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The Collections / Corpus / Text corpus are considered as the resource pool for linguistics based research.  So, Its ok to say that they SHOULD contain all the terms. more details can be found on this wiki  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same collection LM might not be optimal for all queries as the unseen words will always have same probabilities. May be we have more in upcoming weekly chapters.   Prof Zhai's explained more in this book with two better approaches: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/czhai/pub/slmir-now.pdf  See the section 4.2 (Page: 23 of the pdf): ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/82579600-d612-4510-a27c-24db2fd8db83/image.png)

Then I run ```stats.ttest_rel(bm25, inl2)``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try to input queries as arrays rather than the path to the files! ( Also make sure the arrays are floats!) Here is the documentation for scipy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Have you removed all the text from the file. I guess you have text in the file while you just need numbers as input for your function.   You can remove all the text by doing Find and Replace in your text files.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, I figured it out - the values in the array were saved as strings and I needed to change them to floats. Hope this helps someone! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ``` After converting the data into float arrays it worked ```  **One other question here, for both ranking functions which params I should use, for Iln2 I used param where I'm getting max MAP. But how about bm25, should I do the same??** REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For BM25 we also need to experiment with different parameter values (k1, b, k3)  to find an "optimal" ranking function with maximum possible MAP. Then the statistical significance test is carried out by comparing the AP (average precision) values from your optimal InL2 and your optimal BM25 ranker. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Convert the Values into Float while reading them as List. Then pass those lists to the scipy.stats.  Also, make sure you are passing ONLY the Average Precision Values while writing the files. you can write the values along with Newline. (the newline can be removed while reading using list.splitlines())  I was facing the same issue. This resolved it.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can actually copy the printed output in .txt and submit.   Your code for submission should only update score_one and ranking_score and nothing else.

THREAD: Anyone tackle MP3 yet? I've failed to make fast headway despite the references and notes.  Any tips? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Heard MP3 is the most challenging of all assignments. In slack you can search MP3 in the TIS channel to get some hints on the problems previous batch students faced.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I found the lecture slides very helpful.  They show the formulas for updating the matrices in each step.   You just have to implement them into code, which is pretty straightforward once you grasp what the terms in the formulas are/which matrices they correspond to.  The readme.md file also contains a good explanation of the matrices that I found helpful.  My suggestion regarding for loop vs matrix operations: Dont get too fixated on which; just go with whichever is easiest for you to get started.   As you work through the code, your brain will start putting pieces together or direct you to find clarifications on specific things.  Although my solution uses matrix operations, it took me a while to wrap my head around them and to grasp numpy's powerful (and cool!) broadcasting capability.  I think it adds an extra level of complexity (depending on your familiarity with numpy) that's not necessary for a working implementation (for the test dataset, anyways).   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: @David, Can you share your MP3 experience as well if you have already completed?  :)  And any special tips. Planning to start MP3.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. I think the most important thing to keep in mind at every step is: what are the input and output matrices and dimensions?  There are only so many ways of combining these things that mathematically work.  I think half of the challenge is not getting lost in corpus/document/topic keywords - it's hard to keep all the matrices from blending together in your brain. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you David. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Zhou, when you talking about slides, do you mean lecture videos of 9.7 and 9.8? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's the one, the set of slides on PLSA.  The formulas you need to implement are near the end. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm little confused on what is expected to be print out for the iteration loop. Could you help clarify this? 
THREAD: Why the ranker.score(idx, query, num_results)  hangs ? Why the ranker.score function hangs in Python indefinitely. Though I have not updated the ranker function, only used the existing ranker function "metapy.index.OkapiBM25(k1=1.2,b=0.75,k3=500)"   Any Suggestion or hint on what I am doing wrong ?   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e4dfc56e-658e-47aa-83cc-e626e8515338/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It looks like you are running this in a jupyter notebook.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use an IDE to debug instead of notebook. It will be much easier. Alternatively, you can try to add a print statement before ranker.score and see what value of idx, query and num_results it is hanging.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As soon as I place the ranker statement, this things hangs indefinetly, can it be because of the Python version ?  I have printed the idx & the Query. In the last for loop where I have commented everything, the print statement "Coming" shows, however the for loop (2nd last one) doesn't show the print statement ("Coming") even if it is before the ranker.score and it hangs !!

Also make sure the files are being read by your programs. If you launching notebook from the code directory should be fine but if launched from other locations likely the file path needs modifications too... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is better to use an IDE, so that you can debugging and locate exactly which line inside the library is hanging. And going forward, IDE will save you time. I am using Intellij by the way, but any IDE will be fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Better use the other rankers (as sggested in the ReadMe). The other rankers take only 1 parameter, which is easier to follow and get an idea what exactly is needed as part of this assignment.  It is tricky to read the readme but once you get it its easy.

In the videos precision was calculated against the retrieved/not retrieved **docs**, however, here we already have the cranfield data set (which I am guessing is a collection of docs.) so not able to relate how precision is finally calculated using the input from scoring function as I thought it is independent of the scoring and only looks at relevancy and retrieved or not retrieved.

Alternatively, I have searched the paper ttitle in google and found the entire paper without sign in on another website, Check this out: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.8274&rep=rep1&type=pdf  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Let me try to explain Question 2. "cranfield-qrels.txt" has three columns, which should represent Query ID, Document ID, and Gain. A higher gain indicates that the document is more relevant to the query, based on actual relevance judgements.   In this assignment, we are trying to evaluate the performance of the ranker, i.e., we want to see if the ranker could generate a higher score to a more relevant document and rank more relevant documents to the top. The scoring/ranking function is used by the ranker to calculate a score for a given query and document.  After the ranker pulls out the list of top ranked documents for a given query, Average Precision (which is an important ranker performance indicator) is then calculated with reference to the actual relevance score in "cranfield-qrels.txt". 
THREAD: MP2.2 How to calculate |D|? I know |D| is the size of current document. But I do not see any attribute of sd representing the size of current document. So how should we calculate |D|? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: |D| is sd.doc_size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: doc_size represents "total number of terms in the doc", not the length of current document. Is there something wrong with my understanding? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes no of terms in the document is length REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: |D| is sd.doc_size. There's also the sd.unique_terms variable, which is probably what you were thinking but isn't what you want for the ranker equation. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do you want to determine the length of the document , this can be expressed as #of terms only , isn't it correct ? Are you looking for number of lines or size of the document in kb/mb etc ?

MP3 also I heard we need metapy.  So I believe yes, metapy is still needed.    Btw.. metapy runs best on `Python2.7` or `Python3.5`. So if you have any of this two python version you will less likely encounter metapy installation issues.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will need to install Metapy. In case you want to refer the "How to" #106  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks but there a particular reason why we use this package?   There are many packages out there like nltk that are much more used in industry  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It seems like it will be needed for most of the MPs. I have it installed on a Py 2.7 environment and that has worked well for assignments so far.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: nltk is more of an NLP package than text retrieval. i mean this is kind of like asking why would I implement data structures in a ds&a class instead of using a package? because the purpose is to learn how things work. Not the biggest fan of the metapy docs myself, but the minimal feature set has its purposes  And to be frank, while the experience with installing metapy is clearly not ideal, we are CS grad students.. being able to manage a python environment and install one package should absolutely be one of our skills REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Use conda - smooth and keeps your native installations of Python separate. Whatever packages you install on conda stay there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could not agree more, spend quite a lot of time initially to just make it installed and this does not seem to be industry standard library as well  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have the same idea. It seems that the Metapy guarantees to work under Python 3.5 and 2.7 only. I tested other Python versions but encountered some errors during the installation phase.  If you have enough knowledge and time, you can fix them by yourself, but I believe using the guaranteed Python version is the most efficient for our assignments. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You can use conda to create a separate environment. I use the following environment, which works smoothly so far(it is python 3.6). You can check the conda documentation for further information.  `environment-python36.yml` ``` # conda env update -f environment-python36.yml --prune # conda env create -f environment-python36.yml # conda remove --name environment-python36 --all name: cs410-tis-python36 channels:   - pytorch   - defaults dependencies:   - pip=21.0.1   - python=3.6   - Cython   - pip:     - --requirement requirements-python36.txt ```  You can specify fixed versions for the following if you want. requirements-python36.txt ``` numpy pandas jupyterlab bs4 selenium webdriver_manager metapy pytoml sklearn ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks guys the package works w python v 3.7! 
THREAD: MP2.2 Formula Implementation I'm a little confused about how to do the summation. I tried to use this. ``` sum(function) ```  However, I don't think this is the right way of doing it. I was thinking of doing a loop to sum everything up. But, I don't know how exactly to calculate the individual score for each term in the query?  Thank you so much!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you just have to implement the two formulae given in the git readme - tfn and score - nothing else. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You only need to implement the following functions: def score_one(self, sd): def load_ranker(cfg_file):  Implement these two formulas in the first function. This is only per term. The model will sum all together. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is a little confusing, but score_one() expects you to implement the score(term, document) portion of the larger equation that includes the summation, which would be score(query, document). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Just the `score_one` function and the `load_ranker` function. You can keep the remaining portion of the program as is. The summation will be done for you by the program itself (the `ranker.score()` function will internally call `score_one()` and do the summation).  Searching `MP2.2 ` in the campuswire you will also find similar question answered and tips too.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You don’t need to do summation. It is automatically habdled REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: There is no need to create or use a summation function. The only functions that should be implemented are def score_one(self, sd) and def load_ranker(cfg_file). Everything else has already been taken care of. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For the summation query, kindly refer to https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/641   for calculating the individual score, just follow the formula given to calculate the score. To align with the terms for each  variable, you can use the following link, really helped me : https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html 
THREAD: Suggestions on studying for exam Other than reviewing the quizzes and practice quizzes are there any other efficient methods to study/prepare for exams. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Other than the practice quiz, below materials can be helpful 1. Good understanding of the Lecture videos. The lecture videos can be downloaded in pdf format for quick read or as offline videos.   2. Solving practice quiz problems with different parameters, input, output etc. 3. Weekly lectures in Coursera starts with a  overview section where Additional reading are mentioned. The book by Prof Zhai (Text Data Management and Analysis: A Practical Introduction to Information Retrieval and Text Mining,) has corresponding chapters mentioned that can be referred for good understanding too. 4. Coursera week 6 also has a video `Summary for Exam 1` that can be referred. https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/9CAed/lesson-6-10-summary-for-exam-1 5. Office hours is also a good place to take more input from TAs and Prof Zhai.   6. Last but not least, Exam Guide is generally released by instructors (i think couple of weeks in  advance) which can be used as reference preparation guide.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Every week's overview is much important also.  Like https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/0wyle/week-3-overview

THREAD: Week4 Quiz5  Hi all,  Could anyone explain a little bit on this question:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6462c405-184a-4ce6-b4f6-b146d67a4f2c/image.png)  Not 100% of sure about the correct answer.  Thanks for any comments. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Take a look at the likelihood function and two smoothing functions. If word count for every term doubles in one document, both the word counts and document length will double.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: In JM Model,  c(w,d)/|d| remains constant in case you double the terms and the second parameter is constant i.e it does not depend on document length whereas in DP model the second parameter depends on the document length and hence p(w|d) remains same in case of JM smoothing . Hope this helps !!

THREAD: Will lengthy formulas be on the exam? Will we be required to memorize the longer formulas for the exam (from weeks 2-4)?  I know we are allowed scratch paper but not a calculator, so don't know how much 'calculation' will be necessary, as opposed to knowing what the general idea of how they work, what it means when some coefficient is higher or lower, etc. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: It depends on how you define longer formulas. Exam1 should be as easy as freshman-level statistic courses and discrete math courses. If you understand how the formula works, you would know how changes in input would affect the output, and how to plug in numbers for simple cases.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Does " If you understand how the formula works, ..." mean that we have access to the formulas (not memorized but on a sheet of paper, for example)?

THREAD: MP2.2 Ranking Evaluation Thought I just had a passing thought that while our t-test for the assignment has us compare the results of BM25 and our implementation of I(n)L2, it would also be interesting to evaluate our ranker functions in comparison to a null hypothesis ranking. Has anyone given thought to making a randomized ranking function for use in this sort of null hypothesis testing? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Typically you want to reject a null hypothesis to prove your alternate hypothesis is better than it. It's not very meaningful to pick a too weak null hypothesis as the baseline(e.g. the random ranker), comparing to selecting a robust, effective ranker like BM25. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sure, our null hypothesis here is that there's no significant difference in the average precision measurements between BM25 and I(n)L2. I get that and the fact that we can take BM25 as a known quantity. My question was more one of, would this be a valid method to naively--without comparing against an existing, validated ranking function--evaluate a novel ranking function? I may just give it a try with the various Meta built in ranking functions and edify myself.  Thanks for the response, btw. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: And to no one's surprise, the known ranking functions evaluate very well against a random ranker, although I only looked at topK=10 document selection. 
THREAD: Access methods and properties of metapy.index.RankingFunction Hello, Please point me to the Metapy documentation where I can view the properties and methods defined for metapy.index.RankingFunction class. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Actually,  you do not need to know this base class. You only need to override score_one().  It is much important for you to know is a score_data sd object, from which you can get whatever you need to implement the formula provided in this assignment.

It is most written in c++, if you want to know. It is wrapping the loop and you only need to know how to implement scoring a single term. The outer loop will sum your term score. You just follow the formula given with sd properties and everything should be fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's the ranker class in Meta: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/ranker.h C++ as otherwise noted, but useful. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's the example on how to implement a `RankingFunction`.  https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/examples/query_runner.py  In this MP, we need to focus on variables of score_data `sd` object which can be obtained from below documentation.  https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html 
THREAD: Mp2.2 clarification 1. What is the end goal of mp2.2? Lol. The text in the instructions are weighted towards math speak and not everyday language, hard to decipher what I need to do. I understand we need to write InL2, particularly modifying only the "score_one" function within search_eval.py. Are we only **functionally** supposed to be concerned on achieving [this](https://doc-14-ac-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/9vfrjgsp0bkardqadua9agapr5k1aiuk/cnf84a6uqu8ss25hghkvgr201efcqc3i/1631808975000/08564352397998940749/14543551473788757540/1gcbywLx0ZEU3eqxlDtLk6o4Yxd788IiK?e=view&authuser=0&nonce=7q2h7veaagrm6&user=14543551473788757540&hash=kdu2vqi11mloerbopp32njiftld9no9b) within the score_one function?  2. How do you start the script? Other students are suggesting:  ``` python3 search_eval.py config.toml ```  However, when I run the above command, it just hangs at the first line forever. PFB:    ``` Building or loading index... Query path!! cranfield-queries.txt Running queries 0 what similarity laws must be obeyed when constructing aeroelastic models of heated high speed aircraft   ``` In the python code, I am noticing that there's an additional parameter that gets read in outside of config.toml  called "CFG" what is the about and how does this fit into the picture of the assignment?   ``` if __name__ == '__main__':     if len(sys.argv) != 2:         print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))         sys.exit(1)      cfg = sys.argv[1]     print('Building or loading index...')     idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index(cfg)     ranker = load_ranker(cfg)     ev = metapy.index.IREval(cfg) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "cfg" is just "config.toml", the first argument to search_eval.py when you call it.  About your script hanging, just checking the obvious stuff: * In the same folder as your script, are there cranfield-qrels.txt and cranfield-queries.txt files?  * Is there a "cranfield" subfolder with cranfield.dat, line.toml and (optionally, I think) README.md? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am having the same problem with the script hanging, and double-checked that all those files you have mentioned are there. Any other suggestions? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont want to state the obvious, but please stick to the folder structure and guidelines. also, many of the issues faced are basic python issues.  now, to help you, and others, especially for 2.2, it would be immensely helpful if you can paste the folder structure, the command line snapshot (so we can see where you are running it), the content of your config.toml and the search script python code. it is a matter of barely minutes after that. right now, we are just answering based on guesses. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm running the  ``` python3 search_eval.py config.toml ```  command in the root of the repo, where all other files are. Can you point me to the folder structure in the instructions we are supposed to run this command? I don't even see a getting started section for this particular mp. Diving in the deep end here! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you are supposed to run it in the root folder of the assignment. that being said, technically you can run it anywhere provided, the first parameter you are giving correctly points to a configuration file. if you give only config.toml it assumes it is in the same folder. also if you look at the config.toml, you would see it points to certain directories.  That being said, I am not sure how you are getting the output  "Query path!! cranfield-queries.txt"  it is not printed anywhere in the python code. for me, I just get Building or loading index... Running queries Query 1 average precision: 0.2816666666666666 .... and so on for every query (and in the end)  Mean average precision: 0.22746739173035468  copy the code which you are running, then I can comment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I added “query path” as debug remnants to ensure the loop is working correctly REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As mentioned, it gets stuck first iteration. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I cant give any meaningful suggestion without looking at the code of the loop. for example, your 0 should never be printed in the default code, so you added some more debug prints probably. if you can share the loop code, we can see whats going on. else, it is very hard to point whats the issue.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sure, I added the print statements to verify the code was entering the for loop. Seems like it is, but if you think these statements should be removed, I can remove no problem.   My lines are added in red.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I think the end goal of this project is to compare two retrieval functions: ln2L2 and BM25.  2. You can modify the main function in the script "search_eval.py" and manually hard code the file name ("config.toml") in. Or you can pass the file name through the command line (like what u did). I personally prefer the first method.  Also as Slok Kumar said, please notice the relative position between the file "config.toml" and the script "search_eval.py" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think someone pointed out that their python version is incorrect (has to be 3.5 or 2.7) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes. We need to implement score_one function andCall the InL2 ranker by editing the return statement of load_ranker function inside search_eval.py. 2. I think you are using python version >= 3.7. Try using version <=3.6  `cfg` is used to get the query, score and compute the average precision for BM25 and InL2 which is required to calculate the significance.txt (second goal of the assignment)   
THREAD: Lesson 4.3: "presidential campaign update" The document model approach seems motivated by the fact that a user might query terms that don't appear in relevant documents, like "update" in "presidential campaign update".  But here, the word "update" might mean the user wants the most recent information. It's not necessarily a word they want to match.  I know comprehensive NLP is a ways off yet for search engines, but is there value in looking for modifier terms like "update"?  (Then again, if someone searches for "Weekend Update", meaning the title for the "Saturday Night Live" news segment, such a search engine would disappoint them) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: you have a point there. But I would think it would be document model approach + additional approach (to cover the NLP part). I say this since as you pointed out yourself, some users might be looking for the exact term in the name or document.  I guess thats the whole point - good or bad of the document model. you are looking for terms, or the presence of terms, with some additional subtleties.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Some of these systems use synonyms to look up terms as well (e.g., WordNet) 
THREAD: Some Important Facts for MP2.2 Hi I recently finished Mp2.2 and there are some points I wish I had knew before I started. Hope these can help someone:  1. Once finishing implementing the InL2 function in the screenshot, remember to change the caller at `load_ranker` function. **There is no need to add any parameter for this function**   2. You can do a fancy loop to run the query multiple times (potentially with different parameters) and pick the best one but there is no need to. Use the given code can generate the required results.   3. **You cant import scipy**. I think the correct way to generate `"significance.txt"` is to run the code WITH `import scipy` first. Before submission, remove all scipy related code together with the code to calculate `"significance.txt"` and `git add` the static file `"significance.txt"`  generated previously   I hope this can help some other people  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thank you for sharing! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is a helpful post, thanks.  I had the same import issue as your third post. I had to **remove** any mention of **scipy** and **numpy** from my search_eval.py code.  I have a couple things to add:  4.   If you're having trouble with mapping the parameters in the InL2 function to the score_data object, try reviewing the notation used in **Lesson 2.2**. 5.   As mentioned in post #262, |D| represents the total number of **terms** in the document REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Good notes, thanks for sharing !!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Probably better to create a separate jupyter notebook and run your custom ranker experiments there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for sharing! 
THREAD: MP 2.2: which ranker to compare with InL2? MP 2.2 asks us to optimize a different ranker than BM25+k3, but the "Statistical significance testing" section asks us to compare InL2 to an optimized BM25. Is this just for illustration purposes, or do we really need to use BM25? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For the submission of the first part you need to build your own ranker which is InL2 custom function where you need to write the equivalence of the formula given. The BM25 comparison is for the second part where you need to get the average using your ranker you built before and then get the average using BM25, write it to 2 different files (your ranker average in one file and BM25 to another) and then print the difference from the 2 files in significance.txt. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you. Do you know why MP 2.2 asks us to try something besides BM25+k3 in the "Varying a parameter" section? Is that just to get us acquainted with optimizing parameters? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Well when you write your custom ranker you still need to run comparisons with another ranker to show your custom ranker accuracy. There I have used Dirichlet as they suggested to use something other than bm25. So in summary use something other than bm25 to evaluate your ranker. Then while submitting significance.txt compare your ranker with bm25. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think another reason could be: BM25 has 3 parameters, others have 1 - so its easy to see how changing the parameters could affect the MAP (for other algos). also, the slow changing nature of the MAP value in BM25 could be little boring. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The purpose of this exercise is how MAP value is changing . Since BM25 has 3 parameters , you can have a 3 cascaded while loop and changing the k1, k2 and k3 and do a plot on MAP value ...

THREAD: MP2.2 what does self.param in search_eval.py  represents in InL2 function provided kn read.me? Little confused about the significance of self.param in search_eval.py. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: self represents the instance of the class and is always pointing to the current object. so when in the constructor it does self.param = some_param, it initializes the param variable with the value passed when creating the object for the class  in main.  You can also refer to https://www.programiz.com/article/python-self-why for a detailed explaination REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok.what does self.param represents in InL2 function provided in readme? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: When using InL2, self.param will be the **c** hyperparameter, which modifies the weight of the document length normalization in the **tfn** portion of the equation. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: it represents a variable within the class/object - you initialize it to the value passed as parameter. it is a common coding practice.  specifically for Ln2, if you see the formula for score, you would see there is a "+ c" in the denominator. The param is for that part. 
THREAD: InL2 not implemented correctly MP2.2 I think my score function is already well implemented while I tweak the c-value and found the best is 10 but it just cannot pass the AG for some reason. My best mean average precision for InL2 is 0.2396277693793568. I've also check this result with my peers who've passed the AG successfully while using the same c-value, so right now I just have no idea which part of my code went wrong in this mp. Can someone plz check the AG infos reported? With only the info given as "inL2 not implemented correctly" it really doesn't help much with the debugging process.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you do the implementation in the score_one function provided? Did you implement score_one to process a single term of the query? I have seen the AG output go from 'InL2 not implemented correctly' before implementing the function to passing after implementing it, so I believe it is working correctly. You could try printing the average precision returned by your ranker for a given query and document, then manually computing it to see if they match. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've passed the significance and got the 0.3 points but still cannot pass the InL2 test, dude could u plz run locally "python3.5 search_eval.py config.toml" and check whether you also got the value of mean average precision as 0.2396277693793? I am just so curious about what AG is testing for and what is exactly the error instead of just telling "inL2 not working properly", it's too vague..... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The value I get for MAP is > 0.255. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Alright I just re-start from scratch and retrieve I have prior. Finally, when I implemented the code as simply as possible without making any changes to other files or create any other files, It just magically passed.   Some suggestions: 1. do not make change to any other files, like create other py scripts or txts not needed(previously I created inl2.txt and bm25.txt and another py scripts for calculating the diff, also when you run it locally it would produce a fold called idx and with a lot of binary files inside: I don't whether that would influence the running of AG or not since there's very limited err msg given out when AG's done) 2. only make changes in score-one function and call inl2 constructor in load_ranker without changing others. I've changed some parts of main to write into txt files for later significance test processing, this might interfere with the AG process 3. dont worry about the truncations or whatever things like the difference of types while doing calculations, I believe py would handle those stuff for u. eg. when you do int. + float,  I think py would defaultly convert all. stuff to float to save as much of data as you wanted. Just to make the calculation of single score as clear-cut as possible according to the formula in read_me REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: <<1. do not make change to any other files, like create other py scripts or txts not needed(previously I created inl2.txt and bm25.txt and another py scripts for calculating the diff, also when you run it locally it would produce a fold called idx and with a lot of binary files inside: I don't whether that would influence the running of AG or not since there's very limited err msg given out when AG's done) >>  That would not affect the evaluation. you need the text score files to calculate the difference, and some sort of script to do the actual comparison (I created a 10 line python script separately). they were present in my git folders when I submitted.  The idx folder would not influence the running.  In general, I agree with the spirit of the your message - keep it simple. but you have to overwrite certain parts to produce the temporary output files required for the result. Can't go into the coding nuisance for that part in this discussion though. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just curious, did you test significance against BM25 using the parameter settings in the MP 2.2 spec: k1=1.2, b=0.75, k3=500? I'm not clear on whether we're supposed to explore different BM25 parameters in addition to exploring parameters for other rankers. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had the same issue for several submissions until I ran into #691. I defined my own c-value in my codes and it kept showing "InL2 not implemented correctly". When I replaced my own c-value with the self.param, it succeeded. Maybe you can try this. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we are supposed to choose one ranker (I chose Jelinek-Mercer) from the listed ones in the assignment and change its parameters to get different average precisicion. And for the p-value, compare the results you get from your chosen ranker and the Inl2 ranker you wrote. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A small suggestion - Double check operator precedence for accurate results.    (X + 1) / Z  != X + 1 / Z REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That's pretty close, but not meaningful, since the MAP will depend on the c/k2/self.param you've set. The way it looks in the AG, our InL2Ranker class is being instantiated with an unknown self.param and score_one() run against a number of unknown test sets. I would go back to my original suggestion of looking at the avg_p, or even the score_one score, of a known query-document pair.  I also second the other comment suggesting to check your operator precedence, as you might arrive at a similar MAP without correct score_one results.  
THREAD: MP2.2 Do i need to make changes in score_one function or create a separate function?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #641  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes. you will have to modify score_one function. Also  load_ranker function to specify the InL2Ranker. the comments within that method should provide details.

You may print one line before this statement.  Or, you may change the code to get the config file by hardcode it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes it would print one score per line/query and then MAP at the end.  what you are getting is kind of an error message, not an output. fix that and try rerunning. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to pass the config.toml file as a command line argument or, if using an IDE, by setting it as an execution parameter.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have all the faculty links just fine, it's the bios from those links that I am having trouble retrieving  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It appears that there are more than one ```('div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8') ``` in the HTML. Does your previous code crawl the first one or the second one? Without a loop, it crawls the first one, and if there is no <p> in the first one, you will get a None.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In your code div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8' is not correct  it should be  ``` div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8'  pull left. ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: bios can be combined by different parts. you don't need to use one line to extract all info. for example, you can use h1 to get the title, and another line to get the main content REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Solved the problem in office hours!

THREAD: MP 2.2 Lessons Learned I figured I'd share some of the hurdles I encountered following the instructions from MP 2.2:  1. You are replacing the original return value of the score_one method of the InL2Ranker class (as mentioned in other posts) with the formula in the document. Remember it is only for one term.  1. In varying the parameters, you can just use trial and error to find the best c.  You can do it right in the load_ranker function almost exactly as the comment suggests. No fancy looping required.  1. I followed the instructions to write the BM25 and InL2 results to appropriate files.  If you want to use the scipy.stats.ttest_rel function, do it in a separate python script as if you try and use in search_eval.py, the grader will not be happy as the scipy package is not there.  It only checks the value in the text file, it doesn't have to be recreated.  Hope this helps others.  I know a lot of other students posted elsewhere but I figured I'd consolidate it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for sharing this! I think you mean BM25, instead of BM24, right?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did.  Updated.  Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for summarizing  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I would add that the score_data and index classes have several interesting fields.

THREAD: Lecture 4.3 Doc Model vs Doc word count Hello,   I have a question about Lecture 4.3 and more particular about using a Doc Model to sample words from.  According to the lecture it is better to use a Doc Model than the Doc itself (~6:42) but it was my understanding that a Doc Model IS generated by a Document's words anyway.  So if that is the case, why does the word **update** even appear in the Doc Model that we use instead?  The only answer I can think of is because we normalized it given the Background LM, but that was used for a Topic Collection LM, not a single Document LM.  Thank in advance! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Let's understand what is modeling? Modeling is a process to understand a phenomenon. Let me explain it using an example of Capacitor/Inductor/Resistor. when we have a piece of metal, it has properties e.g. getting heated when current is running, magnetism etc., but we model a piece of metal using imaginary models i.e. Pure Resistor/ Pure Capacitor/Pure Inductor/Ideal voltage/current source  to explain what happens in the real world.  Similarly, when we talk about the language model, we are taking some hypotheses to explain a phenomenon of a user entering words query in search irrespective of the presence of word in actual doc retrieved by query.  This is a link from britannica :- https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-modeling   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for your answer. I do have one follow up question however:  If we take this particular Doc Model as a given hypothesis, how do we assign probability values to each of the words in it (even the ones not present in the doc)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In simple terms the word "update" is coming up in the query. Query does not exist in document. This is a valid scenario. Therefore, how do you assign probability to the word that we have not seen.  The above idea extends to further lectures where you will see something called "smoothing" to assign probabilities to unseen words. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, ok, got it. Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the maximum likelihood estimator without smoothing, the words not present will get 0 probability but in further lecture, the professor talks about smoothing the techniques to overcome this problem. The practice quiz has a question for the problem in this estimator :-  <<<<< You are given the query Q= “food safety” and two documents:  D1 = “food quality regulations”  D2 = “food safety measures”  Assume you are using the maximum likelihood estimator without smoothing to calculate the probabilities of words in documents (i.e., the estimated p(w|D)p(w∣D) is the relative frequency of word ww in the document DD). Based on the unigram query likelihood model, which of the following choices is correct? <<<<<<

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the file may be there but the rest of the files it refers to may not be, If I am understanding it correctly it is better to navigate to the folder we clone from github and launch python from there so everything will then be in relative path going forward.

Q9 says "page that only has incoming links" gets the most probability instead of "page that has equal number of incoming and outgoing links".  I am wondering why the number of outgoing links seem to decrease the probability of a node. Is this only happening when there is no random jumping? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Is it because the incoming links are instantiated by other pages whereas the outgoing links are instantiated by that page and therefore that page has complete control over the outgoing links vs. no control over the incoming links? 
THREAD: MP 2.2: t-test for significance testing? I hate to be that guy, but I'm wondering why MP 2.2 uses a t-test, since that assumes the samples are normally distributed. Is it just simpler to run than a sign test, or is the outcome not much different than a sign test? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: From [the link](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman1/auxillar/signtest.htm), you may find:   *The t-test is the standard test for testing that the difference between population means for two paired samples are equal. If the populations are non-normal, particularly for small samples, then the t-test may not be valid. The sign test is an alternative that can be applied when distributional assumptions are suspect. However, it is not as powerful as the t-test when the distributional assumptions are in fact valid. It can also be applied in the case where there is no quantitative scale, but it is possible to order the data (i.e., an ordinal scale). Dataplot states the sign test in terms of medians, but it can also be expressed in terms of means.*   For this assignment, we have 225 queries,  their 'average precision' follow a normal distribution. it is fine to use t test to compare two methods / rankers.   From code side, both are simple, as we are using some libs. Maybe based on Professor's long time observation, t test is better than sign test in this case. The idea here is for us to know how to compare two methods.  I will change this to un-resoved, so maybe TA or professor can give more ideas. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The large number (>30) of queries allows us to use t-test with normality assumption REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: apologies if this is pedantic but the t-test assumes the distribution of sample means is normal, not that the data itself is normally distributed, which is why the t-test tends to be robust  however the sample size at which the distribution of sample means approaches normality does depend on how non-normal the data is   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, you're right -- I should have remembered. My mistake looking up t-test assumptions on sites that skimmed the details. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hm, I get an InL2 average-precision distribution that has a spike near zero, with a long right tail. Wonder if I did it wrong. But Bill Guo pointed out that the normality assumption applies to the sampling distribution of means, not to the raw sample data. I'll go with it.

The issue seems to be that the scraper isn't parsing the correct URL of the element. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No, it means there is a problem with the URLs you scraped. Go to the bio_urls.txt, see what the lines are (every line should be a URL), pick up one or two to check, put them in browser and see if you get to a webpage.

THREAD: c(t,Q) how do we get c(t,Q)?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can refer to this document to find the attribute associated with this value. https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One member variable like sd.*. Look through the api doc, then you can find it.

I know it is not spelled exactly the way it appears in the formula (at least a bit difficult for me personally to understand in the first glance), but you can guess it is that by elimination of the remaining count variables within the object as given in the doc. 
THREAD: Varying parameter questions I ran this code (code provided in the assignment)  ``` # Build the query object and initialize a ranker query = metapy.index.Document() ranker = metapy.index.OkapiBM25(k1=1.2,b=0.75,k3=500) # To do an IR evaluation, we need to use the queries file and relevance judgements. ev = metapy.index.IREval('config.toml') # Load the query_start from config.toml or default to zero if not found with open('config.toml', 'r') as fin:         cfg_d = pytoml.load(fin) query_cfg = cfg_d['query-runner'] query_start = query_cfg.get('query-id-start', 0) # We will loop over the queries file and add each result to the IREval object ev. num_results = 10 with open('cranfield-queries.txt') as query_file:     for query_num, line in enumerate(query_file):         query.content(line.strip())         results = ranker.score(idx, query, num_results)                                     avg_p = ev.avg_p(results, query_start + query_num, num_results)         print("Query {} average precision: {}".format(query_num + 1, avg_p)) ev.map() ``` But that did not have any output when I ran the search_eval.py.  Is this not the way to do it?  I replaced this code in the main.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do we run the code that they provide in the assignment?  Do we need to replace that code in the main function or put it somewhere else?  The code they provide and what is in main is not the same. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue i believe. it was problem with my environment. had to reinstall python/metapy which solved my issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Oh, I see . you are right, I just used the code they provided in the python file, not what is there in readme (assignment). I modified the load ranker (to make loading a particular ranker and change the parameters) and the score one function. the only change I did in main was to output the lines into a text file, but otherwise it was all the same. 
THREAD: Statistical significance testing For Wilcoxon how do we say 95% would be random fluctuation and beyond that would be due to precision? Why not 90% or 99%? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may watch the following 3-min video to know Type 1 error. Or google "Statistical hypothesis testing, type I error".  We assume that a random variable follows a distribution,  so its values will fall in a 95% area (very possibly). It is unlikely to falls in a 5% area, so if it happens then we think our assumption is wrong.  Generally, we select apha = 0.5. For sure, you can set it to be 0.25. It depends on the practical usage.  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/error-probabilities-and-power/v/type-1-errors REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Conceptually this is related to the concept that if a value is within mean +/- 2 standard deviation then it is normal distribution where the values are random.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/76a2c18f-123c-4f29-b1ad-61dad93fb9bf/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For some additional related learning I would recommend researching Six Sigma, which is a standard of lean manufacturing. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma) on this does a pretty good job at explaining why values within +/- 2 sigmas (σ) fall within 95%. 
THREAD: MP2.2 testing InL2 ranker implementation How can I test if my implementation is correct? Can I submit the code by just modifying score_one and changing the load_ranker function to call InL2? Will that tell me if this is working as expected? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When you submit the code, the log file will show success or failure. And if your code is correct then you will see that score as 1 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I pushed to GitHub often to check progress and as specified in the readme - InL2Ranker will be worth 70% and the p-value will be worth 30%. If you check the logs in LiveData, and if your ranker doesn't work, it will say "InL2Ranker not working as expected" but that's as much as it will say. You will know it works if you see a 70% in coursera 😅😂 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: hmmm...there are few things expected here:  1. your code should return a value per item to be scored. you could check this by redirecting the output of the score function to a txt file (one score per query) - the question also indicates that. please note that I dont mean necessarily inside score one function, you can add it to the call to score in main too. you would need the txt files (from both Ln2 and BM25 functions - 2 text files) to compare them later and generate the significance file 2. the score per item should be according to the formula for the Ln2 algorithm. that you could verify looking at the theory 3. there should be a signficance.txt file (manually created as given in step 1 by comparing the two text files scores)  Now load ranker function could be modified (hardcoded) one by one to call BM25 first and then Ln2 (since you need two text files to calculate significance.txt) or by doing some sort of config based approach.  So, without submitting, if you get the two text files and are able to calculate the significance, your code is working. the score themselves are difficult to check - and you can take a sample or two for the Ln2 part to see if they were calculated correctly (you applied the right formula). that should tell you if it is working and working as expected. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can use ```py import os  cmd = "var1 = {0}, var2 = {1}".format(sd.var1, sd.var2) os.system(cmd) ``` to print things to the Submission Log console 
THREAD: MP2.2 Summation clarifcation In the score_one function we are writing are we supposed to assume that we do not need to take care of the summation portion and just write the implementation for one case? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. It is correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you just write the function for each term. You do not need to do summation  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: yes. the parent class does that for you. 
THREAD: MP2.2 C clarification How can we figure out how many times a term comes in the query or document. Is there a function for that?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: We do not care. The model handles it somewhere. We only need to implement the specific interface by following the formula provided by the professor. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The formula has that built in, along with other things. there are few count terms in the formula, so you need to just implement the formula correctly.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Look at the fields of the score_data class. 
THREAD: MP2.2 Do we only need to work on search_eval.py this file? After reading through MP2.2 requirements, my understanding is we are implementing InL2 function in the given file **search_eval.py** and submit it with the p-value.  Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes.  To be specific implement InL2 in the  `score_one()` method. Also check #641   Also, the p-value to submit must be in the numeric form (float number) and not in scientific form.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The p-value has to be float data type REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That’s totally fine

Based on the question, we only have 3 words. p(any word) = 1  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]:  I think you meant to say the probability of any word is 1.. Which research falls into that category.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: p(any word) = p("text") + p("ming") + p("research") = 1, and your know the first 2, so you can get the last one REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Stat knowledge is a little rusty. Thanks!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: 0.4 In unigram model , all probabilities should add up to 1, given that there are only 3 words, and two of them add up to 0.6, the third one's probability would be 1-0.6 =0.4. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Makes sense!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the professor wanted to test the knowledge of the unigram model :-) since clearly this is a trick question and can only apply to one missing word. if 2 or more words are missing, unigram model would not help. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Since we only have 3 words in this entire domain, p(text) + p(mining) + p(research) = 1. To generate the phrase "text mining research," we need all these words together, so we multiply the individual (independent) probabilities.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the unigram model, all the occurance probabilities of words sum up to 1, so (1-0.4-0.2)*0.4*0.2 = 0.032

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Fourth score is the overall score, first one is the gdcp from AP news having weightage 0.1. Second is cranfield data set having weightage of 0.3 and third is the faculty dataset having weightage of 0.6.  I hope this clarifies REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If that is the case, then Rank is wrong - correct ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In my opinion, the rank is calculated from AP news. But you need to surpass baseline score to successfully complete MP2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's correct ... Does it not make sense to put Rank based on the "Overall Score" , not based on one of dataset which carries least weightage ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We can check with one of the TAs REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: (0.1 X 0.4062228	+ (0.3 X 0.346420298)+ (0.6 X 0.907125938) = 0.688823932  and  (0.1 X 0.400295432) + (0.3 X 0.3527179) + (0.6 X 0.92627098) = 0.7016075  
THREAD: MP2.2 InL2 Implementation  I've already implemented the scoring function ("The function you’re writing represents one term in the large InL2 sum"), but I'm not sure how to iterate each term to get the summation for InL2 ranking function (is there a list of terms I can call from the sd object or self)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: yes that's all you have to do... implement the `score_one()`. The `ranking.score()` calls the `score_one()` internally and you don't have to change any logic flow in the main section per se or worry about calling with list of terms. The `ranking.score()`  function takes care of the summation for you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You don't have to write a new function to iterate each term. As Ujjal said,```score_one()``` will be called by ```ranker.score()```. This is because```InL2Ranker``` inherits from its parent class ```metapy.index.RankingFunction```. The ```score()``` method, which iterates all terms using ```score_one()``` has been defined in the parent class. In the MP, the new defined ```score_one()``` overrides the ```score_one()``` of the parent class, but the ```score()``` method of the parent class remains unchanged and can still be used.  
THREAD: Course Project Tools Hello,  Under section 3 of the Course Project Overview from week 1, there is the following statement: > You should try to reuse any existing tools as much as possible so as to minimize the amount of work without sacrificing your goal>   Does this mean we are not limited to only tools implemented in Python? Or, asked another way, If we find a tool/framework/library thats implemented in another programming language like Java or C++, can we use it for the Course Project?  -Eric REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A related question: can we use a 'tool' that is freely available online, with complete credit given to that tool, but use it for a different application? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you talking about MPs? Or final project ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Final Project. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would contact the prof and/or TAs to be sure.  However I would be surprised if you weren't allowed because it seems that any project with a good framework / structure behind it can be proposed ("Free Topics"):  > Option 5: Free Topics You may freely propose a topic that is not listed in this document but relevant to this course. In your proposal, please answer the following questions: What are the names and NetIDs of all your team members? Who is the captain? The captain will have more administrative duties than team members. What is your free topic? Please give a detailed description. What is the task? Why is it important or interesting? What is your planned approach? What tools, systems or datasets are involved? What is the expected outcome? How are you going to evaluate your work? Which programming language do you plan to use? Please justify that the workload of your topic is at least 20*N hours, N being the total number of students in your team. You may list the main tasks to be completed, and the estimated time cost for each task. At the final stage of your project, you need to deliver the following: Your documented source code and main results. Self-evaluation. Have you completed what you have planned? Have you got the expected outcome? If not, discuss why. A demo that shows your code can actually run and generate the desired results. If there is a training process involved, you don’t need to show that process during the demo. If your code takes too long to run, try to optimize it, or write some intermediate results (e.g. inverted index, trained model parameters, etc.) to disk beforehand.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think yes. Tools are just supposed to be convenience, if you innovatively can use it for another purpose, all the more power to you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess the Professor's or TA's response to this question is preferable since they are the ultimate authority on such things. I.e., what any student taking this course now "thinks" is irrelevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your reply David. Where did you get the above quote from, I can't seem to find that anywhere on coursera (or linked to from there lol).

Thanks, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, I contacted TAs and they said we shouldn't worry as long as we had a score on livedatalab before the deadline. Here's also some ways you can try to solve similar problems: > 1.  Try linking your coursera account on LiveDataLab by typing "coursera.org" for Host Domain and using the university email address for Host Domain Username.  > 1. Try reopening the MP by clicking start on **Coursera assignment page** and type in username and password on the LiveDataLab page you are directed to. If you are directed straight to MP page without being asked to enter user name and password, try clearing the cache of LivedataLab website and redo the above steps.  > 1. If all of the above do not work, try clearing all cache of both liveDataLab and coursera, and log in again. If already linked the account, try delete the linked account and link again.  Remember to **push** to github repository if you tried any of the above steps. 
THREAD: Should we get rid of the header of webpage? When we scrape the faculty page, should we skip those words showing at the top of the page such as "Log in" or "Apply now"? Or should we just keep them there and scrape all content in the page? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we have to scrape the relevant bit from it- the bio/introduction for the faculty. Everything else can be trimmed down REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. In the sample that has been provided, it shows that we have to get the data from the main section of the HTML content so that it only takes the necessary info.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Scrape only the wanted details from profile. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I disagree - it’s not a strict requirement. In fact if you follow an example in the bio.txt you would see a para containing everything including the link texts. Now I am not saying that you can’t do it, but it should be up to you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's up to you where you want to start calling process_bio() from. I think it would make the most sense to skip the header and only pass in the soup containing the main body. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Only the necessary information is required 
THREAD: Is it ok to scrap professors' personal page(the page you got by clicking their name in Faculty page) We can get professors' personal page by clicking their name on Faculty page. In the example, the program scraped their 'Home page' inside the personal page, but what if they do not have a home page? Can we just scrape the URL and content of their personal page? To be more specific, for example, can we just scrape the page https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/zaher instead of 'Tarek F. Abdelzaher's home page' link in this page if they do not have one? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, the autograder does not care about which page is scraped. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The sample code already has a logic if the home page is not found it scraps the profile page. So what you are doing is correct.  Try looking for the comment in the sample code  ```  #treat faculty profile page as homepage ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that should be fine

THREAD: MP2.2 c value I'm working on MP2.2 and am confused by what c means in the InL2  formula. At various points in the formula it says c(t,D) or c(t,Q), but isn't c a numeric parameter? What does it mean for c(t,D), is it the term count?  Apologies if I'm missing something in the instructions, but just want to clarify. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: count  or  number of times  for e.g.  `c(t, D)` --> Number of times the term appears in the current doc `c(t, Q)` --> Number of times the term appears in the query REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: C function denotes the time term appeared in the document or query  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This was confusing initially. c -> parameter C() -> implies a term weightage based on query/document etc 
THREAD: Is that okay to include 'chromedriver.exe' file in my submission? Since it's needed by the scraper and the instruction in example code said that it should be downloaded to current directory('scraper_code' folder). Is that okay to submit my work along with this file? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that is OK. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is not necessary. If you commit it also, no harms. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Either way it's fine.  It is not required though.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. Included in my assignment and no issues. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yea , you can include it. I also did without any issue REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Its usually not preferred (frowned upon) to upload an executables directly on Git.  you just need to put the absolute path of the chromedriver (can be anywhere on your system) in the driver object creation step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You could ‘touch .gitignore’ and then ‘git  rm —cached FILENAME’ to remove it from future commits 
THREAD: Is MP2.1 autograded? By that I mean if we get a score of 1 on LiveLab does that mean we got full points and met all the requirements? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. Correct.  Also make sure on Coursera Grade section you have received your grade too. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it is autograded. As long as you see "100%" against your assignment in the Grades page, you are good. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please make sure you see 100% in the grades in coursera page. Initially I got 1 on Livelab but when I looked at coursera I only got 30% (Because I did not check the google sheet before and used a link taken by another student.) That is a special case, but anyway checking the grades in coursra is the safest way : )

I've been trying to fix this bug for a while now but am at a loss, help would be much appreciated! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: ``` 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text'``` Your code is trying to call `get_text` from `profile_sec`. But `profile_sec` is empty (None). Check how you are you getting data on `profile_sec` and probably fix that (it should not be None). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm adding data to profile_sec like this profile_sec = soup.find('div',class_='field-engr-link')     if profile_sec is not None:         all_websites = profile_sec.find_all('a')  since there is only one a tag under that div class  ![siteInspection.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/39501ff4-265e-42bd-9c09-3f6131555f72/siteInspection.PNG)  but I'm not sure why it's showing as None? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: hmm.. looks strange as it should get the element.

Any ideas?  Ps thanks so much for trying to help with this, it's much appreciated REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try printing `all_websites` after the `profile_sec` line  to see if it has any values.  Also the line just below the try appears to do nothing . That line may need a revisit too.  At any point you can print your variables to see the content, if that helps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried printing but receive the same error and no printed output D:  So stuck on this, thank you for trying to help REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Look for your first `profile_sec` variable and try to print that. which should be before the first `if` statement in the above code. Most probably the issue with your first `profile_sec`  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok this is weird, I tried printing the 1st profile_sec and it prints out 'None'!

THREAD: bios.txt formatting Hi, I just wanted to confirm if my bios.txt formatting is correct.   If I were to have 35 faculty member urls in the bio_urls.txt file, then should I also only have 35 lines in the bios.txt file? i.e. we should only have one line for each faculty member in the bios.txt? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Correct...  and each line number in `bio_urls.txt` should refer to the data with same corresponding line number in `bios.txt`. In short, you have to maintain same order in both files.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that's the expectation. The sequence of faculty url in bios_url.txt and biography in bios.txt should match. Sometimes if the biography is too big, the editor would wrap up the information into multiple lines. That should not be a problem. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes , that is the correct  understanding

Question 3: How to use jupyter notebook? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One home page has multiple professor urls. Based on these urls, you need to find detailed bio REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yu do need more than 5-6 faculty urls to be graded properly. I suggest, google for a university "computer science university faculty" and try to find a suitable university. (It might take a half n hr, but you will find one, which is not used yet). Do an inspect on the faculty page to see if the page has  href tags and urls. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The expectation is to first find a university and dept that has not been scrubbed already. Once you find it, then scrub and find out all the professors in that dept. Publish this in the bio_urls file. Then scrub these individual faculty's bio from their individual pages and publish in bios file and the sequence should match the one in urls file. Also you do not need jupyter notebook for this and can just do by with python...

THREAD: What to do if most professors do not have a bio present? as title. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Use a different university or dept. or You can ignore them if they do not have a bio. However, at least 6 is good enough. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Does the bio_url link take to the page where professor's some info is there?  As long as you have information for the professor from the original bio_url link you should be good. The corresponding professor page may or may not have a link to their home page.   e.g. for UIUC English department there is only information about the professor but no home page [](https://english.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jbarnard) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I chose to ignore those without a bio, and it worked fine. I believe you'll need at least 6 examples, based on other posts I've read. If you can't get that many examples, I'd choose a different webpage. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: None of the professors on my page had a second level homepage link, but all had an institution hosted bio webpage. I just scraped those pages and got good information and full credit on the MP. 
THREAD: Selenium on an as-needed basis The MP readme describes this briefly, but keep in mind that the use of Selenium is only "as-needed" and depending on your faculty website, you may not need to go through this process.

THREAD: bios.txt and bio_urls.txt empty for sample code When I run the sample code given to us, bios.txt and bio_urls.txt are both empty after I run it. Is the code given there incorrect? why does this occur? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will have to modify your code based on the corresponding university / faculty page. The sample code is for html of UIUC page, though there have been changes in UIUC html too. Therefore, it won't work without necessary modification based on current html.  Please refer to beautiful soup [reference](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and a good explanation from Tengjun [here](https://github.com/ttt-77/MP2.1-sample-code ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not modifying the code at all. Please read the question. I am deliberately trying to run the UIUC faculty page. I am deliberately running the exact same sample code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: UIUC faculty html page also had changes. Sample code is not as per current html of UIUC. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes the sample code is not up to date  to match the latest version of the faculty page. Or in other words the sample code is not being maintained for any changes in the UIUC Website. Last year, UIUC website went through some major UI changes  which i guess broke the full functionality of the sample code. 
THREAD: MP2.1 Using the sample code I am assuming we are allowed to use the sample code and change it accordingly to match our specific use cases, is that correct? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Yes we are allowed to do that. The only think you are not allowed to do is use any UIUC faculty pages. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that is correct. You can make appropriate modifications to suit the department you have picked. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, and make sure you do not use any existing faculty page as well. Addition to that, i found adding an else condition in the step where you search for text on the scraped html page. This will help you debug whether you are getting any data or not. ```  if bio.strip()!= '' and bio_url.strip()!='':         bio_urls.append(bio_url.strip())         bios.append(bio) else:        print ('No Data found !!!') ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also consider using something like Visual Studio Code to step through your script and inspect the variables. Here's a doc to walk you through how to use VS Code for Python debugging.  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As long as you produce the required output files and have the required structure, it is allowed. It has been helpful to keep printing the extracted elements (from `find` or `find_all`) /urls and tailor the loops according to your webpage - which you can write yourself with the help of the view page source option.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, and if I may add most of the code for scraping is redundant- your structure might be very simple - I personally deleted all of it and just coded 3-4 lines to scrape my code.

My query is how to get the a href under span instead of div tag REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You are getting error while fetching 'href' from anchor (a). This happens if there is no anchor element in 'link_holder'. I guess the span element you are looking in the html page with class 'field-content' has the anchor but there might other span elements without the anchor element.  I recommend printing the element when you face this kind of issues to identify which span element matches the class but not having anchor.  ``` print(link_holder) ```  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You could consider retrieving the faculty list first by doing a  ``` facultyList = soup.find_all('div', attrs={'class': 'views-row', 'class': 'academic'}) ``` Then you can extract the faculty name and URL.  ``` for faculty in facultyList:     facultyItemSoup = faculty.find('span', attrs={'class': 'field-content'}) ``` Where the faculty name can be extracted using facultyItemSoup.text and the URL by doing a subsequent .find on facultyItemSoup for the 'a' element and extracting the href as you have already done. I tried this on my machine and was able to extract all 37 of the faculty list items with name and URLs.  I found it useful myself to construct a dictionary of faculty with fields of name, URL, and bio. Also don't forget to cleanup the extracted text from the faculty pages to ensure there's no erroneous new lines. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I figured it out but thanks Ben! I was able to get all 37 faculty members too :)  
THREAD: Scraping faculty url error I'm trying to scrap faculty url but it's throwing a weird error.

Try finding the driver on your computer and then press shift while you right click, there should be an option to 'copy as path' that should give you the path. Note: this is for windows if you have another system search online how to find the path of a file it should be similar.

THREAD: In this scenario, we care more about recall, right? Hello, I am doing the practice quiz 3 and a little confused with the below questions: In such scenario, we hope to caught the relevant posts as many as possible, right? Which is to say that the measure of recall in F-measure should be attached more importance. Also, I am thinking why higher beta could bring more weights to recall, any explanations would be appreciated. (I plugged in some numbers into the F-measure formula to confirm with my guess).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/af6cf28d-3ba0-4484-85e6-cdad3c8cdec1/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Very good explanation in #531 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: How I understood this question is that we want to have high recall because any time someone is tweeting about a terrorist plot it is important to know.  So in this context -> F-Measure (beta often set to 1). Beta controlls the emphasis on percison/recall. A smaller beta value, such as 0.5, gives more weight to precision and less to recall whereas a larger beta value, such as 2.0, gives less weight to precision and more weight to recall.  Therefore since we want high recall we want a higher beta value. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I explained it in 531 as link given in an answer below, but the simple explanation is that precision*recall/precision+recall - which is a simplification of formula - when precision goes higher the sum (in denominator) goes towards it - thus the division would cancel out precision/precision leaving recall - on the other hand if recall goes higher the sum would be closer to it, thus cancelling recall/recall in the formula.

Once you clone the repository as "MP2.1_private", you need to create a new directory "scraper_code" (which will have your selected university faculty page scraping code). That scraper_code will contain the .ipynb (python notebook) OR .py (python execution file) - You can select any of the two ways of writing your code.  When you execute the code , the "bio_urls.txt" and  "bio.txt" text files will be created inside this "scraper_code" directory (The text files position doesn't matter, it worked for me).  Just re-using the Sample code and making tag related modifications (after inspecting the target HTML) will create these text files in the required format.

This will help in debugging whehter you are getting any text OR not. The possible reason for No text in the Bio files is that the tag you are looking is not present or you are finding the incorrect HTML tag for the object you are looking for.  ``` if bio.strip()!= '' and bio_url.strip()!='':         bio_urls.append(bio_url.strip())         bios.append(bio) else:        print ('No Data found !!!') ```

Print the `all_headers` variable and see what values you have there. The code above is just a sample code (and not any generic code) which will only work for UIUC Computer department faculty page as it is extracting particular set of elements from the UIUC webpage which might be different for other university webpage. You have to tweak or twist the code or write fresh code based on your university web page.   Good luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah I understand that.

THREAD: Discounted Cumulative Gain weight On lecture 3.5, its seem lower rank document is given weight of log(n).  Since log(n) < 1.0 where n < 10 (assuming formula is log base 10), doesn't this effectively give more weight to lower rank document?  Instinctively, don't we want to penalize the gain of lower rank document?   Thank you REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the log is base 2 (not base 10) therefore log 3 will be 1.58 therefore we will penalize the document by dividing the weight by 1.58.

The git project contains only Cranfield dataset , am I missing anything here   thanks, Abhijit REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The main objective is that the ranker you write should be more general and should be able to return accurate results over unseen data sets too.  See the following in Readme *You may use the provided cranfield dataset to evaluate your rankers/parameter settings locally  but remember that the leaderboard ranking is based on the performance on all the 3 datasets, so please make sure you do not overfit*. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: From previous years Slack conversations, its seems pretty clear that  we will not get the other two datasets. We need to train on Cranfield dataset and the ranker will be tested against all three.  APNews dataset, and the Faculty dataset are kind of hidden datasets that our code will be tested on for the competition..

THREAD: FYI for Week 5: Kullback–Leibler divergence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence  Kullback–Leibler divergence From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search In mathematical statistics, the Kullback–Leibler divergence, {\displaystyle D_{\text{KL}}}{\displaystyle D_{\text{KL}}} (also called relative entropy), is a measure of how one probability distribution is different from a second, reference probability distribution.[1][2] Applications include characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference. In contrast to variation of information, it is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure and thus does not qualify as a statistical metric of spread – it also does not satisfy the triangle inequality. In the simple case, a relative entropy of 0 indicates that the two distributions in question have identical quantities of information. In simplified terms, it is a measure of surprise, with diverse applications such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and bioinformatics.

THREAD: Practice Quiz 3 Question 6 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f8686b23-33f2-49f8-869c-061671fa449a/image.png)  My understanding was that F measure balances the P and R values to  give us a more complete evaluation metric as it is a harmonic mean. Answer suggests that increasing the beta parameter puts the emphasis on Recall. How? Can anyone show it mathematically with the F-Measure equation? May help me understand this better.  Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I selected "Lower" at first but think the answer provided is correct. This is a kind of situation you want to make sure you go through as much information as possible which means higher percentage of R in F calculation.   For example, there are 10 tweets that contain some hints of the attacking plan and usually they are pieces of information. Government agent needs to connect them to figure out the real plan that can stop the plan. You want to review all of them to make sure you can make right decision. When you find out 5 of them, you may have higher precision rate but you may not be able to make correct decision based on them.    You can see from denominator in the below equation. If beta is large, the percentage of the recall R will be higher  in F as well.

But remember, this is a division, so the closer you move to precision, the more the ratio (precision)(recall)/(precision+recall) moves towards (precision)(recall)/(precision) thus cancelling the precision part, and giving more importance to recall.  On the other hand, when beta is small the ratio moves towards (precision)(recall)/( recall) thus cancelling recall and giving more importance to precision.  You can verify it mathematically using different values of beta. Sorry my theoretical maths isnt great, I just used some logic to arrive at that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What we need is Recall to be higher compare to precision. when BETA = 0 in F-Measure F0 = Precision when BETA = 1 in F-Measure F1 = (P*R)/(P+R) and so on.  as you see above, as BETA increases Recall is rewarded. Therefore answer is higher since we want a system with high Recall

THREAD: Grid for Precision and Recall  In the below grid 'b' falls under [Not Retrieved, Relevant]. What does that mean? How do we know the relevancy if the document is yet to be retrieved?  In Recall calculations it looks like the 'a+b' is just the total collection of documents irrespective of relevancy.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/47120f99-7599-404a-8051-e3ae13b01bf3/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Basically, before you evaluate the system, you clearly knows which are related and which are not related. Here,  **Relevance Judgments** is a good reference data, which is generated by some experts somehow. It is like a job interview, you an interviewer knows the answers (Relevance Judgments) already, so you can judge.  **Given one query**  like the following picture, we know that in the data collection we totally have 10 related documents, and system A only give you 3 results (D2, D1, D4), based on **Relevance Judgments**, you know they are related (D2+, DD1+ sign), or they are not related ( D4-), so following the table you provided, you can calculate.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b013eac1-c9e4-4182-81fd-e35272497f95/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: > In the below grid 'b' falls under [Not Retrieved, Relevant]. What does that mean?  Ways to think about **Precision**: - are retrieved results relevant? - what % of all docs we returned/retrieved were relevant/correct/true?  Ways to think about **Recall**: - have all the relevant docs been retrieved? - what % of all the relevant/correct/true docs did we return/retrieve?  In this case, it essentially means that our algorithm said a document was NOT relevant, even though it was.  > How do we know the relevancy if the document is yet to be retrieved?  To calculate Precision and Recall we need to have a master list of correct answers, for example: doc1: relevant, doc2: not relevant, ... lastdoc: ___ So, whether we retrieve it or not, we have the answer as to whether it is relevant  > In Recall calculations it looks like the 'a+b' is just the total collection of documents irrespective of relevancy.  total collection of documents = a + b + c + d  All this is confusing because it's set up in the context of Precision@ and Recall@.  It may be easier to think of it first as the algorithm returning all documents and setting them to True/False.  Then think about how Precision and Recall would work if we calculate each of them for each cumulative list:  [ Precision/Recall for [doc1], Precision/Recall for [doc1,doc2],...Precision/Recall for [doc1:docN]] REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are calculating recall upto a cutoff point, say 10. Said differently if we retrieve all documents then recall will always be 1. Hence a+b is documents retrieved till the point we stop, and the ones that we haven't retrieved. Hope that helps REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the detailed answer, makes sense now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: b is pre-determined to be relevant document count, in testing the system under controlled conditions. that is how we are testing the precision and recall (again in lab conditions).   In real world situations, yes you are right, you can't just tell based on a search that the recall factor is x since you dont know which unretrieved documents are relevant.

Seems strange though that it would be sensitive to capitalization of characters. When pinging, for example, sending requests to GitHub.com or github.com makes no difference. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Generally, a web server is case-insensitive to process URL, but Apache or Nginx could make case-sensitive through the configuration change. I guess this topic is the case. It is not surprising an error is occurred because of the case (although not a generally accepted practice).

Also when they say scrape the page and save the "content",what is the content here? Does it include faculty image,contact number,education,research publications etc or just short intro at the beginning. Eg: http://www.msrit.edu/department/faculty-detail.html?dept=cse&ID=0  should I scrape the started short intro about the faculty and save in a text file?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok, I also suffered a similar issue. The faculty page in my first target school had only a short introduction under the same page, no link to the faculty page as an external web page.  I also considered scrapping those sub-pages and submit as it is, but eventually decided to find another university because the suggested sample code seems to expect us to scrap independent faculty web pages (outside of faculty pages in university).  Scrapping sub-pages is also scrapping obviously, but I guess it is safer to follow the structure and intention of sample files. Just my opinion. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The university that I have chosen does have individual faculty webpages.Unable to scrape that content to put in a txt file REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Similar confuse.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, so I decided to change the university to scrap due to the same issue. Again, scraping those faculty introduction pages is obviously scrapping, but I decided to follow a safer way. It depends on you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "Also when they say scrape the page and save the "content",what is the content here? Does it include faculty image,contact number,education,research publications etc or just short intro at the beginning."  Going by the sample given, it includes everything on the page (the visible text) - even if it is the text for links and menus. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to ensure that you have at least 6 links in the bios_url.txt. Also, all the links in bios_url.txt are called in bios.txt or at least you have information for each of the link.   In order to help you read html and write the code, it will be helpful to "right click" on the page that you navigate to for bios.txt and "Inspect" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Bios can be scraped from either the homepage itself or a separate faculty webpage as far as I understand. One tip would be to select a university with a homogenous landing page for all faculty pages. This can ensure that you're only scraping static websites with a fixed structure REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There are several ways to remove the HTML tags using BeautifulSoup. See [this stack overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16206380/python-beautifulsoup-how-to-remove-all-tags-from-an-element).  You must also remove any carriage returns from the bios. So I just found the 'main' content-y part of the page, and pulled all text from that into a single line. It's difficult to read, but the core point isn't for it to be human readable... it's for a search engine, in theory.

In the example shouldn't this be 2/5 for system A and 3/5 for system B not 2/10 and 3/10? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Recall denominator is based on -- "how many total relevant docs are present among the document collection" which is 10 in above sample. That's why for both example A and B, it is 10 in denominator for calculating Recall.  5 is total documents retrieved in example B and 3 are relevant so precision is 3/5. Whereas in example A, 2 docs are relevant among 3 retrieved docs so precision is 2/3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think your confusion arises from the fact that both A and B combined found only 5 relevant documents from the document collection. They both fell short in a way there, if you can call it that - there were 10 total relevant documents. that is why their recall is lower while precision is higher.  also to be noted that since A and B both give their result as total of 8 (3+5), even at 100% precision their recall would still not be 100% total. That is why the more documents the system returns, the more chances are that the recall would go higher. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "even at 100% precision their recall would still not be 100% " 100% precision is when c=0. 100% recall is when b=0 What does one (c=0) have to do with the other (b=0)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: c and b are fetched or at least derived from the same pool of documents, plus they are bound by the system's efficiency - my point was simply that there is a minimum number of retrievals needed even for the most perfect system (100% precision). In the example, even that minimum is not met. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, but both b and c can simultaneously be zero, which contradicts the claim that, "would still not be 100%" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: no they can't be, for the given scenario of 8 total retrievals (3+5)  - I commented on that specific case. in general yes both can be 0. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In case of recall, I guess it does not matter how many documents are retrieved by the system. To calculate recall we need to consider how many relevant documents are there in the pool of documents.   On the other hand, the Precision does depend on how many documents are retrieved by the System.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to check total documents retrieved in example B, which is 5. There are 3 relevant ones thus the answer for B is 3/5.  In example A, the docs retrieved is 3. 2 docs are relevant so precision is 2/3   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the example give,  System A:  a=2, b=8, c=1  So, precision = 2/(2+1)=2/3        recall = 2/(2+8) = 2/10  System B: a=3, b=7, c=2 So, precision = 3/(3+2) = 3/5       recall = 3/(3+7) = 3/10

THREAD: MP2.1 only checks for bios.txt and bio_urls.txt FYI, it seems that code is not run on the server and only the txt files are checked for correctness.  Without committing the output files ("bio_urls.txt", "bios.txt") to github I got errors.  After committing the txt files, my submission was scored.  Anyone else get this result? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: For my case, the files were generated by scripts and checked in as well, therefore I am not sure if the code is run on the server. You can try introducing a bug in the code and check. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: that is so weird! maybe your code was writing to a file without creating/opening the file first? That's my best guess. I submitted with the txt files and got a 1 so I moved on lol REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It appears that the script is not actually being run. I introduced a syntax error to my script, and the submission still said "success". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: According to some people on this [thread](https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/488), submitting without the chromedriver for selenium still results in success, which makes me think that our scraper.py script isn't actually being run (if it were, the absence of chromedriver should result in an error). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it looks like the submission checks only 2 results files and does not actually run the submitted script.  That's weird but also makes sense. Because scrapping documents from the Internet does not always guarantee a consistent result. There are many factors that affect scrapping including internet reliability, security configuration, and even government policy. Even you can find the order of scrapping is not always the same whenever running your code.  Due to those complexities, I guess the class decided to trust our results, but also I believe there will be some instruments to detect abuses to make all fair. That is my opinion. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the similar situation. I just pasted the 2 output to the main folder and then problem resolved  
THREAD: Practice quiz 3 -Question 5 How to understand and explain system A always has higher recall than system B when system A has higher precision at any position of k document. Does this also apply to when system A has higher recall at any k document than system B then system A has higher precision at any position ? Question: "If system A has higher precision at k document than system B for any number of k, does it mean A also has higher recall than B at any position?" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "at k document" means using system A and system B to retrieve top k documents for the same query. If system A has higher precision then system A retrieved more relevant documents than system B, therefore the recall is also higher.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The trick here is to assume there's a fixed number of relevant documents -- say, 10.  Recall = (# relevant documents retrieved) / (# all relevant documents) Precision = (# relevant documents retrieved) / (# all retrieved documents)  For A to have higher recall than B for any k, A must always retrieve more relevant documents than B for each k. This also means that A always has a higher proportion of relevant documents in what it retrieved.  If system A and B both retrieve 3 documents, and A pulled 3 relevant documents while B only pulled 2:  A's recall = 3/10 B's recall = 2/10  This automatically means that a higher proportion of A's retrieved documents are relevant:  A's precision = 3/3 B's precision = 2/3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: " Does this also apply to when system A has higher recall at any k document than system B then system A has higher precision at any position ?"  I would think yes. if A recalls more documents than B at given k, it means it retrieved more relevant document, given k retrievals, thus, its precision would be higher than B too. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Following is taken from the course transcript for better understanding to answer the question  <<<<< So, when would see another point, where the recall would be different? Now, if you look down the list, well, it won't happen until, we have, seeing another relevant document. In this case D5, at that point, the, the recall is increased through three out of ten, and, the precision is three out of five. <<<<<  Therefore recall changes only when the next relevant doc is in the ranked list. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here's a counterexample to the claim below: "if A recalls more documents than B at given k, it means it retrieved more relevant document, given k retrievals, thus, its precision would be higher than B too." Assume there are 20 documents, 10 of which are relevant.           A                                                                 B           4       6                                              3           7           9       1                                              5           5           ------------                                         ---------------------          13     7                                               8          12 recall:   4/10                       >                 recall: 3/10 precision: 4/13=0.31        <             precision: 3/8=0.38    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A post below states, "If system A has higher precision then system A retrieved more relevant documents than system B, therefore the recall is  also higher." Here's a counterexample. How about A: a=3, c=3   and B: a=4, c=6 So precision A: 3/6         and B: 4/10 Here, precision(A) > precision(B) but A retrieved 3 relevant documents and B retrieved 4 relevant documents (i.e., A retrieved FEWER relevant documents than B) Since the number of relevant (a+b) documents is fixed, A's recall would be LOWER than B's in this example.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the question also states at a given K so if the system is at the 5th doc (k=5 i.e. retrieved only 5 relevant docs out of 10 relevant docs) the recall for A is 0.4 and B is 0.3 and the precision for A is 4/5 while B is 3/5 so A is still having a higher precision. Any thoughts on this? 
THREAD: Question about PennTreebankNormalizer In the **POS tagging** section of https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1,  why do we need to use tok = metapy.analyzers.**PennTreebankNormalizer**(tok)?  By examining the output tokens, I observed "can't" being changed to 'ca' "n't", and all the other tokens stay the same.   I assume this might be another filter in the tokenization stream, but was not able to find much information on what it does exactly. Could anyone please share some insights?    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As stated in MP1, "Each tag indicates the type of a word, and this particular tagger was trained to output the tags present in the Penn Treebank tag set." .PennTreebankNormalizer() is a function to perform POS tagging on tokenized sentences. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After executing this block of code: doc = metapy.index.Document() doc.content("I said that I can't believe that it only costs $19.95!") tok = metapy.analyzers.ICUTokenizer() # keep sentence boundaries! tok = metapy.analyzers.**PennTreebankNormalizer**(tok) tok.set_content(doc.content()) tokens = [token for token in tok] print(tokens)  The output is: ['<s>', 'I', 'said', 'that', 'I', **'ca', "n't"**, 'believe', 'that', 'it', 'only', 'costs', '$', '19.95', '!', '</s>']  The output does not show any POS tags, so it does not seem that PennTreebankNormalizer() has performed POS tagging on the sentence. Looks to me that the following tagger is doing the actual POS tagging:  tagger = metapy.sequence.PerceptronTagger("perceptron-tagger/") tagger.tag(seq)  So back to the original question, what is PennTreebankNormalizer() doing here? :)    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you want to do POS tagging over some text, you will have to first ensure that all the tokens have some sort of 1:1 mapping to the tag set in the tagger bank (Penn Treebank, in this case). So the PennTreeBankNormalizer does this step and converts tokens to some canonical form recognized by the treebank. There's a file `ptb_normalizer.cpp` in the metapy C++ codebase. You can check its references to see how its being used before the POS tagging. Also, check this out: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/331895 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This makes a lot of sense, thank you! 
THREAD: Are Exams open book? Are students allowed to refer to notes or slides during exams?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No.   The following policies will be enforced while taking your exam:  The exam will be closed notes (i.e., no external material allowed). You may use two sheets of scratch paper during the exam. No calculators are allowed.  No bathroom breaks are allowed. If you are disconnected during the exam for less than 5 minutes, log back in to ProctorU as soon as you're able to resume the exam. If you are disconnected for more than 5 minutes, you must reschedule the exam with ProctorU. Make sure your internet connection is stable before you begin the exam. Also be sure to submit your exam before disconnecting from ProctorU.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When you say no external material is allowed, does that mean we can use Coursera notes?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No open book. No external materials other than 2 blank sheet of paper and pen.

THREAD: MP2.1 Submission Files If we are using Selenium, it seems like we need to download the web driver for our browser and use it in the python code like this (this is for Google chrome):  ``` driver = webdriver.Chrome('./chromedriver',options=options) ``` Should we also submit this chromedriver file? The directory tree under part a) of the README does not mention this file, so wanted to make sure if it's ok to submit it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No we don't need to submit the selenium chrome driver. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My understanding is that the chromedriver is needed in order for scraper.py to be run...so does that mean they will not actually run our scraper.py code, and only care about the results in bios.txt and bio_urls.txt? It would be great if an instructor could confirm, thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I successfully submitted mine without chrome driver.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I submitted mine with the chromedriver and it showed success. so not sure if it matters really. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I submitted without chromedriver file and it works fine REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My understanding is that only the txt files are being evaluated. So submitting without chromedriver should work fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I submitted with the chromedriver file and I got full marks on the assignment REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You don't need to submit Chromedriver. There are many types(Windows, Linux, MacOS)  and versions of Chromedriver, and we do not the baseline OS and Chrome version of the grading system.

THREAD: MP2.1 Length Requirement for bios I noticed that in the sample UIUC web scraper provided in MP 2.1, there are around ~180 faculty members whose bios we are scraping.  However, for my chosen university, after filtering out faculty members with empty bios, I only end up with around 50 lines in bio_urls.txt (probably because it has a small computing/mathematics department). Just wondering if there's a length requirement for the number of bios we need, i.e. is 50 too short?  On the same note, is there a length requirement for each faculty member's bio? Thanks in advance!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't think there are any length requirements for either bios.txt or bios_url.txt. You have to use your own judgement. 50 seems ok  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! I also just noticed the first part of the question is already answered in the spec:  ``` a. Submitted all the files. There should be at least six URLs in "bio_urls.txt". Also, please remove non-ascii characters. -- 0.1 points  ```  So looks like we only need 6 urls at the minimum.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes it is mentioned 6 
THREAD: Baseline in MP2.4 In MP2.4,  "You must beat the "baseline" on the leaderboard to get full credit"  How was the baseline being computed in the leaderboard.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Looks like the last column in the leaderboard is used to determine whether the overall score beats the baseline. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same here.. I even got to rank 1, but not able to beat baseline.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Looks like issue is with ranking. Rank seems to be based on first column only.   As per instructions for a score of 1 we need  to beat the base line code.   Need to have overall score greater than "0.70146814" (0.1\*0.39662969 + 0.3\*0.34954323 + 0.6\*0.928237).

THREAD: MP2.1 Assignment and HTML scraping I see the sample code, and it might be a good place to start, especially for beginners. But HTML content for different websites need to be scraped in a very very customized manner, as the structure (and name) of the sections, links in HTML could vary due to the lack of any standards. So, my 2 cents there is that you might have to overwrite the code almost completely to do the scraping based on what university/website you have chosen, and none of the logic might really apply (for example homepage/no homepage) - except the high level faculty page URL and content in the page.  In simple words, you might have to study the HTML of your website and overwrite almost all the scraping logic in the main function. The overall structure and logic of the program still holds though. Let me know what you think. 
THREAD: BM25 in MP2.2? In the "Varying a parameter" section in MP2.2, it explicitly said that   "Choose one of the above retrieval functions and one of its parameters (don't choose BM25 + k3, it's not interesting)."  However, in the "Statistical significance testing" section later, it said  "Use BM25 as a ranker and create a file called bm25.avg_p.txt."  I think the goal is "to test whether the difference between your two optimized retrieval functions is statistically significant." If so, should I use the retrieval function I optimized earlier (and that's not BM25) and compared its results against InL2?  Could you please clarify what should be compared in the significance test? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You have 2 ranker functions - one with BM25 and another one is the one you write InL2. Both these rankers provide some average precision value of queries , think them as arrays and find the p value using the snippet provided in python or R REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could I assume these parameters in BM25 are already optimized?  metapy.index.OkapiBM25(k1=1.2, b=0.75, k3=500)  Or do I need to vary these parameters in BM25 to find the optimized values first? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I keep them as you described REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use BM25 to generate bm25.avg_p.txt and compare that to the your custom function InL2 results. For BM25, I called no parameters (assuming with default values) and it worked.

THREAD: Query/user variety for evaluating TR systems I'm wondering about the variety in query strings and (especially) user purposes when people evaluate TR systems.  Is there a mix of users and use cases, like individuals searching for scientific papers on a topic, vs. those looking for opinion pieces on the same topic, vs. someone just looking for the latest tweets? I can see some people looking for short documents vs. long documents, or documents with more or less loaded language.  I guess my boiled-down question is: do people mostly want to evaluate TR systems for general use, or is some evaluation done for specific types of usage?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: That's a great question! It mostly depends on the TR system that is being developed and the targeted users. For example, Google would want to evaluate for both types of queries and make their TR engine very general to favor recall, whereas Amazon would mostly get very specific queries and would want a very precise system.  However, evaluating different types of query intents is another problem altogether. In the Cranfield methodology, the people who design the queries, also assign relevance scores to the documents. As you correctly pointed out, this set of people could have different notions of "relevancy". Eg Google Scholar, for a query like `Information Retrieval`, some users could consider the oldest paper as more relevant, while some would want a recent survey paper. So if we use a single relevance scale, different users might want to give different relevance scores to a document.  There could be multiple ways of dealing with this problem. For each query-document pair, the relevance score can be assigned based on some aggregation (avg/median score by all users). Or you could design your query set in a way that covers all kinds of user intents. Another way would be to simulate different types of query responses by tweaking your system/model parameters and testing against the same query set. These are all very resource-intensive methods, and commercial IR systems tend to rely more on auxiliary features like filters/facets/sort-by-X to handle different user intents. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! This is helpful. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In addition to Dattatreya's answer, I'd also think there's potential for creating search profiles for different users to determine which kind of TR system is preferred by that user at a particular time. For example, you can run A/B or multi-armed bandit tests on a few different TR systems that are optimized for different types of users. Analyzing the click-through rates for suggestions will help inform the system on which TR system is best suited for that type of user. I think it's also important to consider that a user's search habits aren't constant either; for example, a student's search preferences will vary drastically depending on whether they're in school or on break. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: MABs are quite useful for user personalization on ranked lists. An alternative to different TR systems is having different weight matrices for different user profiles and learning a MAB on them. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for this question and the answers. I was wondering about the same and it makes sense now 
THREAD: Lesson 3.5: lowest relevance level 1 instead of 0? Just curious, is it a convention for the lowest document relevance level to be 1 instead of 0? Is that because it's easier for users to rate documents on something like a familiar Likert scale, such as 1=Extremely Irrelevant, 2=Somewhat Irrelevant, ..., 5=Strongly Relevant?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There's no such convention. 1-N is preferred for ease of interpretation. Source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32389/is-0-a-valid-value-in-a-likert-scale REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, whoops. Right, there is no fixed convention on Likert scales.  It just seemed weird to me that lesson 3.5 assigned irrelevant documents a weight of 1, so they have 1/3 the weight of relevant documents instead of none of the weight. It's better if I just remember relevant documents will always carry more weight, regardless of whether irrelevance is 0 or 1.

As for average precision, it is the area under the Precision-Recall Curve:  ![avg_prec.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2fc6fe3a-47b7-4f2b-93f6-e367470b2cbf/avg_prec.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess my confusion  is 1. What is generating the ranked list? Which part of week 2 is this?  2. If a ranked list is being generated why does it consist of irrelevant documents? If they match the query in some way they are relevant I thought. Is it because the user has graded them as irrelevant? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Some text-retrieval system generates the ranked list  2. You're right -- the irrelevant documents are the retrieved docs that a user has judged irrelevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Concerning your first question about known item search, even if there is only one relevant doc in the entire collection, different TR-systems might place this document on different positions. This is not necessarily always in first place, so there might be some non-relevant documents preceding it. This affects the Average Precision of course, because we divide the one relevant doc by the number of total docs found (all others being irrelevant) up to that point.  Concerning your second question, Average Precision combines precision and recall, because the sum of precision values at each rank are divided by the total number of relevant documents in the collection (not the total retrieved!). Ultimately, any non-retrieved relevant document counts as a "zero" in the sum of precision values. The recall value therefore heavily affects the Average Precision score.

I've looked at other CampusWire questions such as #236, #347, and #270, but none of the answers seem to work for me. It seems like I'm supposed to download something separately and place it in my Python folder? If so, how does that work? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: 1. Download the file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt 2. Place it in the folder where you have your example.py file.  If it is a tagger then download from [https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/releases/download/v3.0.1/greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz ](url)  then in the command prompt execute ``` tar xvf greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When I click on your link in "1.", it just leads me back to CampusWire.  Is there a command/method to move or copy the lemur-stopwords.txt file into the folder where I have the example.py file? Thanks, and sorry for all the questions. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try now the link is correct. You will see a list of several words in your browser. Copy paste those in a file called lemur.txt and save it in your folder where you have example.py REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've followed all the steps you mentioned, but unfortunately it looks like I'm still getting the same errors:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4c274923-7694-46bd-80be-86fbc9a1a84b/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ignore wget command.

Can you confirm that? The tar xvf command is a standard command so it should work as long as you have the file, you are executing the command in the folder where your file is located. ``` tar xvf greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think I am?

I hope you have correctly set up metapy and Anaconda. If not see #106  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do I copy all the files on my local machine? Sorry for all the questions. I think I have metapy and Anaconda set up properly (but I guess I can't be sure on that). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 1) in Python interactive shell, this usage of`wget` is not valid Python. It is meant to be called from command line (outside Python shell). There is also a separate wget module for Python that you can use in the Python shell.  2) I noticed you’re on Windows.   Unfortunately, it’s common to encounter Linux style commands in tutorials that aren’t always Windows-friendly/common knowledge for Windows users. You can do workarounds to install wget on Windows. If it were me, I’d probably use Python `requests` module or just download the file manually in this one off case. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you check at which directory you execute the commands? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Anyone having trouble with the wget command on a MacOS system can replace it by the "curl" command: ``` curl https://some_valid_link/to_a_file.extension ``` 
THREAD: Questions regarding missing mp grade on coursera Hi, I just find my mp1 grade not showing up on coursera but it shows up on my livedatalab: 1  I wonder will I receive a overdue penalty for that? I just emailed uiuc coursera support but they may not be able to fix it before the mp1 deadline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Have you used same email for both the accounts? Generally if you used your illinois email id for coursera account then it should automatically show up on your account. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was having the same problem. Turns out it was because of the email linked to my coursera account. It has always been my UIUC email, but for some reason when I first got my UIUC email, it had an illinois.com domain. It was changed to illinois.edu at some point (briefly locking me out of my school email LOL) and I had to manually change the email address connected to coursera to match the new .edu domain. Not sure if this may be your issue but it's worth checking! Once I had the correct domain reflected on coursera and linked on LiveDataLab, I git pushed and got the 100% in my coursera grades page. Good luck!

(base) PS C:\Users\<workspace>\MP1_private> pip install conda Step 3:    To get comfortable python version to make metapy to work, install python 3.5 following the below command in anaconda installed folder 	conda install python=3.5 To install metapy 	pip install metapy Virtual env : (base) PS C:\Users\itsme\sivaworkspace\MP1_private> conda create -n <env-name> python=3.5 **# To activate this environment, use**      $ conda activate <env-name> Here you could start working on your project.    Check dummy git push whether the project link works fine Commands for git check in 	git add. 	git commit -m “commit message” 	git push “project url” **# To deactivate an active **environment, use     	 $ conda deactivate  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would offer a small suggestion if that makes sense. dont name your environment env or something like that because you might get it confused with a system variable/command etc. I just used "CS410" (or any other string for you - just not system sounding) as the name which can clearly differentiate it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may change this post's type from "Question" to "Note":) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried these steps, but I'm still stuck on Step 2 when I try "pip install conda" because then it says "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." (I'm still working on the problem in #430) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you please try the command in python installed folder. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I could not edit now to Note. I agree . REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Angus, please dont run pip without first solving the conda issue (#430) - if you run pip (even if you resolve the issue with pip) on default command prompt without conda, it would try to install metapy on the default python installed on your computer (3.8 in my case) - and it would fail. you have to run pip within the activated conda 3.5 environment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: >python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip you could try the above command to insatll /upgrade pip, then try conda installation. 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 3 - Question 3 In Practice Quiz 3.3, we need to calculate the average precisions. System A: \[+ + - - - - - - - -\]  System B: \[- + - - + - - - - +\]  My calculation is like this:   PA(A) = (1/1 + 2/2)/10 = 2/10  PA(B) = (1/2 + 2/5 + 3/10)/10 = 3/25  However, the answer is incorrect. Which part is wrong in my calculation?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The query has a total 5 relevant documents. We need to divide 5 rather than 10. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The equation for Average Precision is as follows:  $$\frac{\sum\text{precision at each  relevent document}}{\text{total number of relevant documents}}$$  This is why the average precision calculation incorporates precision and recall: recall is implicitly accounted for in the denominator. @Tengjun is correct with the denominator number. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it was a little confusing for me too, since in the video/example, the number of relevant document was same as the number in the list (10) - probably would have been a little better if relevant document count would have been different (<>10) than the list size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, exactly. That is why I made the mistake in the first place.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: " recall is implicitly accounted for in the denominator." By the same argument, recall is implicitly accounted for in the numerator as well since it too has the denominator of the expression for average precision 
THREAD: MP1 not showing up on LiveDataLab I followed the steps on the doc and set up for MP1, edited examply.py, added the files, committed, and pushed the code.

THREAD: Installed Anaconda, not sure what to do next As per some of the suggestions on the MP1 Setup question I asked some hours earlier, I installed Anaconda and Pycharm Pro. However, when I try the "conda create -n <name> python=<version>" by typing "conda create -n MP1_private python=3.5" in my command line, it says "'conda' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." I have no idea how to get a virtual environment with custom version 3.5 going. Am I supposed to download a version of Python 3.5 myself or is Anaconda supposed to come with it? I'm confused as to what my next steps should be. Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It appears that conda is not in your environment variable yet. You may check this [](url)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44515769/conda-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command  You should not need to download Python 3.5 by yourself, but Anaconda is supposed to do it when creating the virtual environment.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You need to run `conda init` for your shell. It looks like your shell doesn't understand that conda is your default environment. (conda is not on your path).  Check this by `echo $PATH`, check if conda shows up.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5b9bea7f-9dcd-44a0-aabe-a74cbd0eb8d6/image.png)  conda init and echo $PATH aren't working for me either. I've attached a screenshot here showing the commands & errors. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not very sure about how to debug this on windows.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've already been able to log in to my GitHub through SSH, but my problem moreso has to with the command line not recognizing any conda command I put through, and it seems like Python 3.5 and a virtual environment are still missing. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: did you execute conda activate env REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Angus Which OS do you have? there is a very simple reason to commands being not recognized - as someone pointed out your shell (command prompt) does not have the path to the conda command set. Usually when you install conda (or any program) it goes into a directory and your PATH variable value (set by different options depending on the OS) recognizes how to reach that and other programs by listing their folder/file path. so we need to identify which OS do you use, and where did you exactly install conda. after that, its a matter of mins to run this.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Also, I installed conda an hour or so back on my laptop (Macbook pro). I got 3.5 by default - it did ask me to install few libraries (modules) which I did. But I didnt have to install 3.5 separately. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have Windows 10 OS, and I installed Anaconda in my "Users" directory. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok, then here is a link which shows you how to setup the path in windows 10. Remember you are setting the path to the directory where conda.exe file is present (search for that using windows explorer just to be sure).   https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/  after you have set the path, reopen (old command prompt would not pick up the change) the command prompt or powershell and try again. hopefully it should work.let me know if it doesnt. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, but just like every conda command I put through the command line, it still says 'conda' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: you can change the directory in your terminal to where the conda is installed on your system and then run the conda command. It should pick up the command without changing the environment variables.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In case you have Anaconda 3, it is easy to create the virtual environment in the Anaconda Navigator. Attached is the screen shot for your reference. While creating a new virtual environment, you can customize the Python version to 3.5  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c61306b8-1783-4582-a58d-2ecd3901ccf8/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think I found the problem, I had to restart my computer twice to get the system running.

PyCharm Community edition can also be used for commercial purposes unlike the student license. Community edition of course doesn't support many features compared to professional edition but it is good enough for core python development. Community edition does provide virtual env, git, docker, kubernetes etc.    PyCharm Community vs Professional edition differences are outlined here:  https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce  PyCharm Community Edition download link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac  Good Luck.

THREAD: Language in the faculty home page Hi all,  For MP 2.1, I am working to scrap the faculty home page in a university in Korea. But almost all faculty home pages are a mixture of Korean and English languages.  Can I still use them by only scrapping English text from them, or do I need to find other English-only pages? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the instructions, they say they only want ascii characters submitted, so I suppose so long as you can scrape the bio pages while accommodating that limitation, why not? Though to be honest, you're probably making your life more difficult by doing that haha.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You're right. I am walking a harder way, but I have some fun because that gives me some idea of language detection.  Since Asian characters have different code numbers in Unicode, it is not so difficult to extract them. But it will be more complicated to decide the dominant language in a document, which is another topic of document relevance.'  Anyhow, it is more difficult but worth drilling down, especially for international students like me.

THREAD: MP 2.1: how to make sure that faculty don't overlap with other submissions? MP 2.1 cautions that our bio_urls.txt submissions should have minimal overlap with bio_urls from other students and terms. How can we check this? Faculty can have multiple appointments across departments, and I want to avoid overlapping too much with other projects that used the same university. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ideal solution will be to select a university not listed in the sheet. I downloaded the sheet in excel, removed duplicates and then tried to find any university not in the list - preferably not a well known university.  Also, the selected university should have academic faculty page and also link to a page with information about each faculty. 
THREAD: Why is "believe" changed to "believ" after Porter2Filter?  In MP1 after removing stopwords the tokens become ["can't", 'believe', 'costs', '19.95', 'find', '30'].  Then a **Porter2Filter** is applied so that all inflected forms of a word are reduced to the same representation. tok = metapy.analyzers.Porter2Filter(tok)  However, tokens output from Porter2Filter becomes ["can't", **'believ'**, 'cost', '19.95', 'find', '30']. Is "believe" supposed to be changed to "believ" (the ending "e" is removed)? I thought "believe" should be the original form of the word. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: words believe, believed, believing, and unbelievable share the stem (believ-), and have the normalized word form (believe) standing for the infinitive of the verb (believe).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Like Payal said, believe, believed, believer, believers, believes, and believing share the same stem of believ. You can refer to this file for reference: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/92fd04153b471b39a5874936fb32631067081d80/data/porter2_stems.txt  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e2e08106-c4b6-404d-b20e-845c17f34762/image.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if stems are root words then why does a stem like that exist? what does believ mean, it is not an English word. I don't think it is in latin either? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is just a custom name of that group of words. As long as all related words are mapped to the same name it is fine.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Stemming doesn't take into account whether the stem is grammatically correct or in the dictionary. It essentially just chops off the end bit regardless. Lemmatization is something similar but it does take grammar into account. So for example, with stemming, the word "better" might go to "bet" (depending on the specific stemming algorithm), but with lemmatization, the word "better" would go to "good."

THREAD: Success Shown as .5 on Leaderboard for MP1 Hi I have pushed my changes and it shows as a success on LiceDataLab, but on the leaderboard it only shows a score of .5. I can't see any logs to show errors of any sort so I am confused how to find what test cases I am failing. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not sure if this is helpful, but did you run the code and see if the output is what you expected to get? If it is not then maybe its a slight issue in the code? Also have you checked to see if you can see a grade on coursera? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will have to create your own tests and run your code in your own terminal to confirm that all the required tests are passing. Livedatalab does not provide sufficient logs to perform testing there.  Ideally, you should see score of 1 that will translate into 100%.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, my output is what I expected and it shows a 50% on coursera as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am having this same issue as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I found out my problem, check that you satisfy all of the cases. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There probably are some issues with your output. If your code is correct, it will show 1 on the leaderboard.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! I checked all cases and the changes worked REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same problem. This is due to issues in the code.

THREAD: Does Google use BM25 or any of its variations? Hi everyone,  Do you know if Google and similar search engines use BM25 or any of its variations to rank results?  It is well known that pagerank uses a link/edges matrix to sort results (ie. pages with most incoming links, in particular from pages that also have most incoming links, are placed at the top of the ranking) but going through this class I realize that text retrieval is much more nuanced than that. Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks, Diego REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Hello Diego,  I think BM25 is surely popular and I believe that most search engines are using it. You can easily build one with Whoosh. But it is merely the first step. There are also a lot of other works that need to be done to evaluate the usefulness/relevance/credibility/... of the documents.   Many new techs use some language models to vectorize both the query and documents and calculate their similarities. The advantage of this approach is that it relies more on the meaning of words. Sometimes a document may not contain the query but it can still be very relevant. There are still some search engine tools, like Weaviate, supporting this function.  One latest but significant improvement that I know is that Google implemented BERT in their search. The search query may not be a simple phrase, and it can be some long sentence that involves pronouns or even complicated grammar, and it used to be the parser's job to understand the query and summarizes the query with some key phrases and weights. BERT turns to do a better job of understanding complicated queries. You can do some research on BERT if interested, it is a very influential model in NLP recently. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Very nice answer.

I was running into similar errors when I was trying to install first `META` (per the text) and then `metapy`, but with a later Python version (3.8.x).  One thing that was getting me farther down that (ultimately unsuccessful) route was looking at that `config.log` file and finding and addressing what error was specifically mentioned in there. Since 3.5.x is not working for you, but did for me, I don't know specifically what is wrong, but my only recommendation is to find and inspect that `config.log` file.

This is roughly what I did.  1. sync GitHub repo folder from MacBook to Google Drive using Google Drive for desktop app. 2. mount Google Drive to colab, so you can access your python files in colab. Put this in a cell and run it. ``` from google.colab import drive drive.mount('/content/drive') ``` 3.

THREAD: Query Likelihood Probabilistic Model One of the assumptions in the model is that if a word is not seen in the document, its probability is proportional to its probability in the collection. However, my understanding is that the Collection Model does not have every vocabulary like the Background Language Model.   What if the word is also not in the Collection Model? Won't the probability of the word be 0 under the Collection Model and break the assumption? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that is the assumption you make exactly!  If you're genuinely trying to achieve good smoothing and account for any range of input the use might throw at you, it is in your interest to use as expansive of a Collection Model or Background Language model as possible. (a bit of a spoiler though: in future lectures, they get into something called pseudo-counts, where you artificially add counts to the probability of words to make sure there aren't non-zero probabilities. Using this approach, you could add a probability value to every word that doesn't show up in the document model or collection model so that the probability isn't zero, but still make it smaller than the probability of every other word so that your can still retrieve documents when a more obscure word is queried). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Or the possibility of variations of a word with a similar meaning (i.e., car is not present but automobile is). Does WordNet take care of such things?

THREAD: Collection Model vs Document Model In Lesson 4.2, it talked about Collection Model vs Document Model, and I want to better understand the difference. Is the difference simply between multiple documents as a collection vs a single document? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Short answer: yes, the number of documents is the distinctive feature. However, the reason we use each of them is also different.  With Probabilistic Models (models with a probability distribution for the word frequencies), the document model simply refers to the relative word frequencies for a single document. While you could theoretically have a "collection" of a single document, that kind of defeats the purpose of using a Collection Model.   We can use a Document Model to determine many things about the text within a document or the author. In order to determine these aspects, we have to get rid of the "noise" from the single document.  The reason we use a collection model is to get rid of that noise. We "smooth" the word probabilities associated with the Document Model (since not all the words that might come up in a query could possibly be contained in one document) and we account for commonly occurring words like "the" so that we can get rid of background noise in our Probabilistic Models. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the answer and it helps.  Further question. If we want to "smooth" the word probabilities, why not use the Background Language Model instead? Could you elaborate in what situation the Background LM vs Collection Model would be more appropriate? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm assuming that the background LM has a lot of stop words whereas the collection model is more specific to the topic we want to model. 
THREAD: MP1 Coursera grade not showing Coursera is not updating my grade for MP1, here are the things I have tried:  - I have made sure that I have the same Coursera and LiveDataLab university email addresses as usernames - I have linked an account on LiveDataLab with Coursera - I double-checked that I followed the setup instructions - I clicked on "open tool" on coursera MP1 assignment - I made sure I am not using github-dev  I've also pushed a dummy commit with every attempt with no success. I don't know what else to do. Any help would be appreciated.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Not sure if this will help, but I had to create my LiveDataLab account twice; ie. it looks like the first time for some reason the system didn't save my data. If you log out of LiveDataLab are you able to log back in? (I logged out and couldn't log back in and had to create my account again, even the original user name I had used was available.)  If you're not able to log back in, you might need to create your account again (using your uiuc email address/etc) and see if that helps. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm assuming that your livedatalab is getting updated with your push , if this is not then its a problem on github webhook configuration . Otherwise, attend one of the TA's session and they should be able to help you

THREAD: IDF compression gamma, delta Hi,   I am basing this question on the slides from #133  In this example for gamma, compression of 9 shows as 1110001 where 1st part is 1110 = 1+floor(log 9) (base 2) = 4 = 1110 in unary 2nd part is 001 = 9-2^floor(log 9) (base 2)=1 = 001 in binary.  In lesson 2.5 the prof says 5 is 11001 1st part is 1110 = 1+floor(log 5) (base 2) = 3 = 110 in unary 2nd part is 001 = 5-2^floor(log 5) (base 2)=1 = 01 in binary.  why is 1= 01 in binary in this example and not 001 like in the first example? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: From the slide, floor(log(5))  = 2, so two bits are required. Note this log() is using a base as 2.  From a different way, as 5 = 2 ^ 2 (this 2 decides the bits for the 1) + 1, the last 1 should use two bits, so 01.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6553e704-2b2d-4472-89c0-b4a4f44e6b3b/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The logic for gamma code is  (1+floor(log(x)) + binary offset floor of log 5 is 2 and floor of log 7 is also 2 therefore you need binary 00 (for 4); 01(for 5); 10 (for 6) and 11 (for 7) for binary offset part so that you can uniquely identify nos. from 4 to 7.  floor of log 8 is 3 till floor of log 15 is 3 therefore you need binary offset for 8 nos.

THREAD: Question on Zipf's law Hi Prof., TAs,  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/d36e3bb1-f1e0-4bbd-b98a-40ef3a0a7a03/image.png)  Zipf's law states that stop words are of higher frequency, if this 'law doesn't hold good' would imply that all words are evenly distributed in the language making the inverted index document frequency of each word even, so, wouldn't that make retrieval faster? as opposed to having stop words with large frequencies spread across all documents increasing the number of rows in the postings?  Need some clarity here please. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Zipf's law also states that many/most words are rare and don't occur in many documents. The inverted index enables a retrieval algorithm to quickly fetch all the documents that match each query word (by Zipf's law, there aren't many such documents), and only score such documents without even touching any other documents. If Zipf's law doesn't hold, it would mean that all words occur in many documents, thus the inverted index wouldn't be so helpful since for every query term, we still need to process many documents. However, you are also right that if the frequent words aren't so frequent, scoring documents for such frequent query words can be faster than if they are very frequent. A user's query, though, often contains content carrying words instead of stop words, so the impact on the rare words would likely override the impact on the very few frequent words (Zipf's law says that there are not many such very frequent words).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, it is clear now.

THREAD: Multi-level judgment document score of 0? In lesson 3.5 on multi-level judgments, the last slide says that ML-judgments can run on a scale of [1,r] where r (rank) > 2.  So in a very fine-grained ML-judgment system where the number of ranks = 10, one could have a document score of 1 for the least-relevant one, 2 for a slightly more relevant document, etc. up to a score of 10 for the most relevant document, as far as I understand.  Why, though, would we not be able to apply a score of 0 for the "non-relevant" documents? It seems intuitively valid to grant a score of zero to a document that the user has gained nothing from processing it. Is there any reason not to? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think conceptually it is because we are trying to perform discrete analysis on a continuous system. Think about radio waves -- unless they are absorbed, they could travel forever. The power density would be so low of course so as not to be useful, unless you could integrate out to infinity. Someone will correct me if I am wrong, but there is no way to say a document has objectively zero relevance whatsoever. When google returns a blank results page, I would wager that there were plenty of hits, just none over a particular threshold. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: looking forward to an instructor answer, but I don't think there is any problem with saying a doc has 0 relevance. If you shift your relevance scores down to the [0, r-1] range the relative ordering of nDCG scores among a set of queries should be the same afaict  As other reference points, [in this paper's description of DCG](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zha/CS8803WST/dcg.pdf), they use relevance judgments that start at 0.

THREAD: Sort based inversion Hi all, I am having a little confusion on this slide.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/65dffa81-37c7-4fab-af5c-6ed9c23e1c5b/image.png)  Step 1: sort by doc-id - clear Step 2: sort by term-id - we can see <1,1,3> and <1,2,2> for term 1 which are terms from 2 different documents  but why isn't <1,5,3>,<1,6,2> or any of the other term-ids '1' coupled together in the 1st box? Step 3: merge sort - Here i believe they are coming together but none of the term freq. values are consistent. I am reading this <a,b,c> as <term-id,doc-id, term freq). Does this slide need to be corrected or is my understanding incorrect? REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: Yes, the slide do have a consistency issue. The Local and Merged frequency values for the term-id "1" are inconsistent.  But, i think the gist of this diagram is to just give an overview of the process not the actual values.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: - Step 1 : We go doc-by-doc in sequential order (1doc-1, doc-2, ... doc-n). Once a document is parsed, the system needs to decide if the number of generated tuples (<term-id,doc-id, term freq>), are enough or more document can be parsed. This is based on the amount of RAM allocated to the sorting system. Other way of design can be that Document parser/tokenizer is a different system and the tuples  (<term-id,doc-id, term freq>), created by tokenizer are streamed. The sorting system (with its limited memory), will load just enough tuples (as the available capacity of RAM).  - Step 2: Local sorting (based on TermId) happens for the currently loaded tuples. These tuples can belong to only one document or 5 documents or 100 documents, depending upon the RAM. Also, these tuples are already sorted based on DocID (since the parsing/tokenizing system is reading them in sequential order). Once the local sorting is done, the sorted tuples are written back to disk as "temp" files. This is what we see as "solid" line in "local" sort step in figure above.  This should clarify the question:  "why isn't <1,5,3>,<1,6,2> or any of the other term-ids '1' coupled together in the 1st box?". Simply, because, the RAM of "local" sorting system, is only loading tuples from few few of the documents, at a time.   - Step 3: Finally when all the tuples from all documents are sorted in step 2 and lots of temp files are created on disk, the "external" merge sort happens. We can read about external merge sort here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting)  To your other question, about term frequency, I am not sure if I am looking at it correctly. Because, to me they look good. For example 1st tuple <1,1,3> is present correctly in last "merge sort" step also. Same goes for tuples like <1,2,2> , <1,6,3>. The only one that looks wrong is <1,5,2>. In the input side it was <1,5,3> but it seems to be incorrectly mentioned as <1,5,2> in output.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: appreciate the detail answer, looks like <1,6,3> has the same issue as <1,5,2> as it was <1,6,2> in the previous step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thank you for your clear answers to the question! Indeed, my slide had a typo. "(1,5,2)" and "(1,6,3)" in the third column should have been "(1,5,3)" and "(1,6,2)", respectively to be consistent with the second column. Thanks for catching the error. I will try to correct it.

Try doing this in a User folder.. something like C:/Users/<yourUserName>/  you can jump on to your user folder by just running any of the below commands -  ``` cd cd ~  ``` This will take you to your user home folder... There you should be able to clone. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you so much.It worked

THREAD: tok not defined in MP1 submission Hi,  I'm getting a "tok is not defined" error in the Submission Log in LiveDataLab for MP1, but when I run my example.py in Powershell it works fine. Any suggestions?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I hope you have modified only the portion of code in example.py where it is mentioned and not anywhere else. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi,  Please make sure you have named the variables correctly. You can follow the examples on the assignment page.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had a similar error.You can resolve by  1.checking the code once thoroughly. 2.No unwanted indentations  3.See if you are doing all the git commands correctly. cd <directory_of_git> git add . git commit -m "comment about submission-1" git push origin main REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I defined it like in the MP1 tutorial. For example, as below: tok = metapy.analyzers.ICUTokenizer(suppress_tags=True)  Is there something else that should be done to define it as "global"? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No special action needed around the scope. The user defines `tok` inside the provided `tokens_lowercase()` function (similar usage as the ReadMe demo).  If you haven't already, check that you've added, committed, and pushed the most recent code. It sounds like your current version is right if you're not getting the error locally but maybe a stale copy is getting pushed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: By default, the variable 'tok' is not defined in the 'main' branch.  We will get this error for the first submission without the implementation. The grader tests only the 'main' branch.  If you are pushing your changes to a different branch, you will see this error in the grader but it compiles in your local. 
THREAD: Live Data Labs "No logs available yet" I have spent over 2 hours trying to fix this problem with no results. I looked at all of the other suggestions from the campuswire posts: I created a new repository, I linked github and LikeDataLab multiple times, I created new webhooks, I made sure that the account was the correct Github account and saw the code being updated on github, but this issue still persists for me. When i try to submit my code, it says that  there are no logs available. I have tried to fix this issue for over 2 hours now, and I am unsure what else to do. Does anyone have any suggestions?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: my issue, which may or may not be your issue, was that I was using a different github u/n when I logged in via Terminal (I was using my email for my u/n) as compared to the github u/n I used when I linked my github to LiveDataLab (I was using my github handle).  so after using the same u/n for both, it worked for me. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may try to register again. Maybe the username and api key you provided cannot be used to log into github.  May look through the following pictures.  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/300 https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/255  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you doing the git add,commit,push commands correctly?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: UPDATE:   I ended up solving this issue by deleting all of the linked accounts on Live Data Lab, deleting the repository, and basically starting fresh. I did this two times, and I am unsure why this worked the 2nd time instead of the first: The only major change that I believe I did was that I used the original API Key that I created from the beginning in the Live Data Lab rather than creating a new key and using this second token's key. After that, I created a new repository and started fresh. I hope this helps.

So I created a new account by going to - https://github.com  and now my URL looks like this one (which  works with the LiveData) - https://github.com/ksoniuiuc  
THREAD: Script to automate MP-assignment repository cloning/mirroring Below is a batch script (Windows-only) you can use to easily clone, mirror, and clean-up the GitHub repositories for each MP assignment. You'll do this at least 3-4 times in MP2 alone, so it's worth it.  Copy/paste the script below into a .bat file, and open it from the folder you want the MPx_private folder created in (probably C:\git\your-github-userid\).  It will automatically: 1. **Prompt** for your GitHub user-id, and for the assignment name (MP1, MP2.1, etc.... must be UIUC's repository name) 2. Auto-browse to the 'create new repository' page in GitHub and **wait for you** to create the new repository (name with "_private" auto-copied to your clipboard) 3. Auto-clone the repository to your machine, commit/mirror to your personal repository, and delete the UIUC folder from your machine 4. Auto-browse to 'add webhook' page for your repository and **wait for you** to create the webhook (url auto-copied to your clipboard) 5. Auto-clone your personal repository to your local machine  When it opens your web browser in step 2 and pauses, you must do the task before pressing any key to continue.  ``` @echo off setlocal set /p u="Your GitHub UserID: " set /p a="Assignment (MPx.x): "  echo. echo Create a new private GitHub repository called %a%_private (copied to clipboard). explorer "https://github.com/new" echo %a%_private| clip echo. pause  git clone --bare https://github.com/cs410assignments/%a%.git cd %a%.git git push --mirror https://github.com/%u%/%a%_private.git cd .. rd /s /q "%a%.git"  echo. echo Assign your new repository a webhook with 'application/json' data type to: echo http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger (copied to clipboard) echo http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger| clip echo. explorer "https://github.com/%u%/%a%_private/settings/hooks/new"  pause  echo. git clone https://github.com/%u%/%a%_private explorer ".\%a%_private" echo. echo Done. Good luck. echo.  pause ```  (I was too lazy to install the GH CLI to automate the browser bits.)

THREAD: Error when running sample MP1 code Hi All,    I am getting an error when i run the below sample code. I manually downloaded the .gz file as python was having some invalid syntax error. I have the file located in the same folder as Python.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/26ba6944-19da-4ec1-8565-0d3db35036c1/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/8b8dc4f6-a5aa-463c-8495-e4cb7e032e5a/image.png)  What is the mistake here? It is a direct copy from the sample code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Just run tar outside of your python environment (e.g.: from your Console)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Tar.gz is a compressed file and tar is a decompress command. You can go to any extractor/decompressor and just copy the contents of the compressed folder to the location of your python script. You don't necessarily need to run tar within your python script. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: all the "bash" code written like below, will run on terminal usually a prompt like $ or =>  (Open 2 terminals / consoles - one for bash and one for python )  ``` '''bash ''' ```  all the "python" code written as below will run inside python Shell, usually with a Prompt like this >>> ``` '''python ''' ```  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think the confusion is on running Python code in the shell vs the command line which can look similar.  For background, when we are in the Python shell (aka the “REPL”, read-eval-print-loop, interactive mode), we must enter valid Python code.  The wget and tar commands are for the command line environment, which is separate from the Python shell. You can use ctrl+D to exit the Python shell or type `exit()`. An alternative to run wget and tar is to open a separate terminal window to run the commands so you don’t lose your Python state. Or you can download and unzip the files manually as others have mentioned.   Digression: interactive Python is convenient for quickly testing things out and inspecting intermediate states. However, if you want your code to persist, then you will move it to an .py file. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Refer to my answer for #270 :)

THREAD: MP1 compiling on livedatalab but no score Hi everyone! I completed my MP1 assignment, it runs on my local machine, compiles on livedatalab successfully but my score is 0!!!! I did include all the lines of codes that we needed for the string operations asked in the MP1. I do not have any print statements in the lines of codes we added(just the print and output from the preset code in example.py) I did remove the line 'your code here'. I do have some commented lines in the code but that should not cause the problem, right? I am running out of ideas now. What else can I look at. My local machine is running the script fine and outputting the processed trigrams. I have messaged a couple of instructors too but I am stressed as the submission deadline is approaching and I am clueless on the actual issue. Anyone has any ideas I might find luck trying? I am using Python 2.7 and my submission file name is example.py(in case that matters) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The comments shouldn't matter. When it gets compiled it ignores those. And are you sure you are properly running through the right things for the trigrams?  1. Write a token stream that tokenizes with ICUTokenizer (use the argument "suppress_tags=True") 2. lowercases, removes words with less than 2 and more than 5  character 3. performs stemming and creates trigrams (name the final call to ana.analyze as "trigrams")  And then the trigrams from there are used below the  #leave the rest of the code as is REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, I figured out the issue after all. Would have been nice if livedatalab had given some vague idea on why I didn't get the score....I didn't need the actual test case but at least some pointer to tell us which step/section of the code is not looking right. I am dreading the next assignments after 'failing'(not really) miserably on this easy one :( REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Surabhi,  I am kind of facing a similar issue. The code status says "Success" in the logs but the score isn't updating. Not sure what am I missing. Could you please help in figuring out the issue? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had similar issue. I was not following the instructions correctly, missed "lowercases" and "stemmer". Got score 1 once these were fixed in the code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Read the instructions in the last section where it is telling us what we need to do to example.py. If you think you met all requirements, read the instructions again and again until you figure out what you missed(or added extra). At least that is what worked for me.

THREAD: "name the final call to ana.analyze as "trigrams""? One of the requirements for MP1 is to **name the final call to ana.analyze as "trigrams"**.  I don't understand that why we can't just return tokens? What's this ana module for here? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: ``` ana = metapy.analyzers.NGramWordAnalyzer(2, tok) bigrams = ana.analyze(doc) print(bigrams)  ``` If you see the above code, we first get tokens and then formulate bigrams or triagrams from those tokens. Therefore, we need a variable. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you check the following code in that method, you will see it actually uses variable "trigrams" and try to construct the final return value. Since you are not supposed to modify this block, you will have to give the variable in your part the same name. I also believe they will check if the function return value is expected, so you will need to make sure everything is in expected format.  ```     #leave the rest of the code as is     tok.set_content(doc.content())     tokens, counts = [], []     for token, count in trigrams.items():         counts.append(count)         tokens.append(token)     return tokens ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "Name the call" here just referred to as "assignment" of the function's return value. They probably tweaked this so student don't get a direct HINT and have some brainstorming

THREAD: IDF(W)  calculation in week2 first lesson Hi,  Can anyone help me understand the week2 first set of slide, slide 10, how is the IDF(W) calculated?  According to the formula, it should be log[(M+1) / K]. How can word Presidential receive 2.5?  Thank you, Shubha REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 2.5 is a hypothetical number used in the example. What we have to understand is that word "about" has IDW of 1.0 as it is less relevant vs "presidential" which is more relevant and as a result "Presidential" will have a higher contribution to the similarity function.

Any guidance on which one is correct, or if I am mistakingly comparing two totally different concepts.  Thanks Kautuk   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The encodings are different because unary encoding is defined differently in slides and in the textbook, I guess. Check out #269 for a more general definition of the Gamma code. In that definition, if you flip the bits of the Unary code part, you will get encodings like they are in the textbook. I guess both are acceptable forms of representation in the Unary code. The instructor/TA can clarify if the one used in the slides will be the one we will follow in the rest of the course.

THREAD: Fixing Coursera grade update issue for MP1 I was having trouble with having my grades updated on Coursera despite the leaderboard showing 1 for MP1 on LiveDataLab. I then realized that it was happening because my Coursera login ID was my personal email address. Changing my Coursera email address to Illinois one fixed my problem.  1. I changed my Coursera email address to Illinois email address by following the instructions here: https://www.coursera.support/s/article/208279576-Change-your-Coursera-account-settings . It is basically just going to the 'Settings', updating the email address, and verifying it.     I also emailed UIUC-Support for Coursera to confirm that my current progress in courses will not be affected by this change. They replied saying that by updating your email, it will not delete the progress or courses that you have already taken.  2. I opened the tool using the 'Open Tool' option on Coursera. I then made a dummy commit and pushed the code again to GitHub. After the autograder ran and the leaderboard score got updated to 1, my grades got immediately reflected on Coursera.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: I was facing the same issue. Since my Coursera email address was my personal email address, I changed it to Illinois email address, opened the tool from Coursera again and pushed the code again. I can now see the grade reflecting on Coursera.

THREAD: Issue while updating pip Hi, while using the command: pip install ---upgrade pip mentioned in MP1, I get the following error. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/41f5f637-a169-4d01-a336-1502156b2b0e/image.png)has anyone faced the above error, if so how were you able to resolve it? Any help with this will be highly appreciated. Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Upgrade your pip REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you're using Python 3.5, upgrading pip will likely put your installation in an unusable state as the latest version of pip no longer supports 3.5. I installed Python version 3.5.4 and was able to install metapy and use it in assignment 1 without updating pip (Skipping that upgrade command entirely). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You are probably running a version of pip that was written for a version of python older than you're running. Pip 8.1 is insanely old. You can either upgrade your pip version ("pip install --upgrade pip"), or downgrade your python version (probably a bad idea). But be forewarned that if you are using a version of Python older than 3.6, upgrading pip to the latest version will probably break it. I posted a thread about it elsewhere on here a few days ago. 
THREAD: When reviewing "Tokenizer," a question cofused me. Here is a screenshot from the textbook (p.148):  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/bc3c2beb-bbe4-498f-b379-d8261c0936b3/image.png)  Are there any real meanings to count the number of ***"."*?** The same question for ***"'s"*.** Many thanks for any sharing.  Thanks. ZiZi REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This is just the result of aggressive tokenization, based on different kinds of punctuation symbols. You can use a stopword-removal-filter sort of thing to remove this kind of noise. Or switch back to a less aggressive tokenizer (eg one which just used whitespace as token delimiter).

THREAD: Expected results for MP1 Just a FYI.  Hope if you know the expected behavior, you may save a lot of time to imagine what is wrong.  I struggled a long time to pass MP1, because I am not sure  Livelab ENV is wrong or my code is wrong.  At last, I read the requirement again, and changed my code  a little bit, and submitted again, and passed MP1.  It is clear that you cannot find any useful information in the submission log. If possible, TAs may add some more friendly information so we can know we failed some cases.  To summarize, you may check the following pictures after you submit your code.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2cf4d929-6757-442a-b458-eb0bd31ba15a/image.png)   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fd33c153-4c4c-46e3-999e-2f8e878d86c5/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/120ef4b9-826b-4189-9db3-a0c6b2601405/image.png)

However, the deadline for technical review is after the proposal deadline for course project.   What is the expected timeline/order for working on them? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, it's better if you base your project on paper survey. We will have a list of project topics that you could choose from and we will also provide relevant papers there. You could start your tech review before your project. You can also choose your paper for tech review specifically. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Can we choose a topic that is not in the provided list?

THREAD: IdealDCG is calculated based on a specific query/doc collection I was confused at first about this slide where IdealDCG@10 is calculated. It seemed to me that every term in the IdealDCG formula is 3 * log(i) where i is the rank of the document, however the last term is 2 * log(10) which seemed like a typo.   Then I realized that the IdealDCG is calculated differently for each document collection/query. In other words, the value of IdealDCG changes based on the combination of doc collection AND the specific query during testing.   In the specific case above, there are 9 "very relevant" docs, and 1 "somewhat relevant" doc, thus the ideal case would be that the 9 "very relevant" docs are ranked top, and the 1 "somewhat relevant" doc ranked below them, thus the IdealDCG would  be calculated as the formula in the slide.  On the other hand, if we have a different doc collection/query, and there are 1 "very relevant" doc and 9 "somewhat relevant" docs, then the ideal dcg would be 3 + 2*log2 + 2*log3 + ... + 2*log10.  Hope this helps!  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/45752758-415f-4539-a7e1-952ce8676897/image.png)

THREAD: Practice Quiz 2 - Question 11 In the Week 2 lectures, it is explained how TF and IDF both are high for the stop words. But in the practice quiz the answer says that the IDF is low.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/371e5810-f2d0-411d-8ace-2c4e4b0b0b24/image.png)  Is there some ambiguity in the answer or am I missing something? Please help.  Thanks!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The TF(term frequency) would be high since stop words occurs frequently but the importance of the words (inverse document frequency) would be low. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Wouldn't the stop words occupy a lot of space in inverted index? The posting entries for such words would be very long. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Usually no processing is done on stop words. They are filtered out. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: IDF is given by the formula  log ((M + 1) / df (W)) M is total no. of documents in collection df(W) is total no. of docs containing the word W  In case of stop words df(W) is high therefore IDF is lower.   Also, stop words will occupy lot of space in the inverted index. We do not include stop words in processing because they are not relevant for search and this saves space and also improves performance.

Rather than executing in the command line (on your local machine), you can import corresponding modules in Python and work with them.

Is that correct ? if So ? How is this decided ? why not base of e or 10 ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, the values are calculated using log base 2. I think this has got to do with the binary representation of numerical values in all the encoding methods, since we are converting a number from the decimal system to the binary system. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I figured that its base 2. But, looking for a bit more detailed explanation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See this page. This one is like a protocol. To know more, you may read some papers:) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Log2 seems to be the standard everywhere for compression and normalization. How is this decided? I believe it is nothing more than a commonly agreed protocol.   I found one interesting logic related to biostats : That's a matter of taste. A doubling (or the reduction to 50%) is often considered as a biologically relevant change. On the log2 scale this translates to one unit (+1 or -1). That's a simple value, easy to recall, and it is more "fine grained" than using higher bases (like log10). A doubling on the log10 scale translates to a change of "just" 0.3. Further, it is relatively simple to project the fold-changes. Most peopple have less problems to calculate 2^4.3 in their heads than e^3 (both is roughly 20-fold). And, finally, computer people (like bioinformaticians) are used to use base 2 because of the binary representation of information in EDP. There is NO MATHEMATICAL reason to prefer any particular base.  Source : https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_do_we_usually_use_Log2_when_normalizing_the_expression_of_genes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When deciding to scale down data using the log function, important to consider that the range of inputs. For a large data set log base 10 make sense indeed. Buy in the case discussed in course deals with INT. MAX INT or long long(GNU C data type) is still reasonable to compress with log base 2 compare to log base 10.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The Gamma code was developed by Peter Elias in 1975, so we call that the Elias Gamma code, too. When he developed the code, he used $$log_2x$$ and others have accepted that as an effective and efficient methodology enough.  That's the reason. If another base such as e or 10 would be more efficient, somebody will announce them as a revision like 'Gamma+,' like BM25+. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Unary allows us to do variable length encoding because it contains a delimiter (0) that tells you when to stop reading bits. However if you want to encode 18, which is 10010 in binary, you would need 18 bits which is inefficient.  Gamma code just encodes the leftmost bit in unary (1|0010 -> 11110|0010) to keeps the information of length of bits and encode the rest in binary for efficiency.  floor(log x base of 2) + 1 is the number of bits in binary,  floor(log 18 base of 2) + 1 = 5. The gamma code put this information in the start of bits so that you know you need to read only 5 - 1 = 4 more bits.   
THREAD: Questions About L2 Formula I had a question about MP2.2 I was hoping somebody could help me with.  What do the following variables represent?   1. $$c(t,Q)$$  2. $$c(t,C)$$  3. $$c(t,D)$$  4. $$|D|$$  If I had to take a guess I would say:  1. Total number of terms in the Query  2. Corpus term count  3. Total number of terms in the document  4. Number of documents REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi,  I think your guesses are all correct. You can actually refer to some of the lecture slides from week 2 as there are similar notations there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought the last one should be the document length? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you are right. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it is the document length.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: From the MP2.2 README, right after the "tfn" formula, it states "Q,D,t : the current query, document, and term". Since D refers to the current document, |D| is the total number of terms in the document. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So if |D| is the total number of terms in the document, then does that make c(t,D) the number of times the term appears in the current doc? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Answer to my own question - Yes. 
THREAD: Webhook Invalid HTTP Response 401 Hi, I am not sure why when I try to add webhook, github gives an invalid HTTP Response 401. I have looked at some suggested solutions to a previous post (#204 ) with the same issue, but I am still unable to solve the issue.  (Also, in #204 , one of the suggestions was to "Generate the token again in GitHub with a longer validity period", but I don't see any options to do so on GitHub.) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: [github tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)  point 7 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![no%20expiration.JPG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c7c8f624-c371-4bb3-8b0c-47a26230041b/no%20expiration.JPG)  I am not sure why there's no option to select the expiration date?  Edit: nevermind, I switched to a different github account and it works now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is weird, mine has the token expiration option.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f96e355f-40bb-4f26-a613-3ee674f6b496/image.png)  You could still try creating the token and check if it has an expiration date after creating it. If it doesn't have an expiration date then it should be fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, it works now, thanks! :) 
THREAD: Document Selection : Classifier Confidence for Ranking I had the following thought after watching Week 1's lectures:  If we rank the results from Document Selection in the order of the classifier confidence (or uncertainty), will it give me a relevant document *ranking*?  Is the classifier uncertainty anyhow related to the resulting ranking, or the uncertainty arises from other sources which need not be related to the document relevance?    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we can surely select documents according to their relevance score. But doing it the other way around is still a great research topic. [This paper from Google](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/7180cffd6a8e829dacfc2a31b3f72ece-Paper.pdf) mentions that "a higher confidence score from the model does not necessarily imply higher probability that the classifier is correct". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Confidence scores are usually tricky imo. You can look at the concept of calibration (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/270508/meaning-of-model-calibration).   Sometimes even for seemingly high performing models,  the model tends to misclassify with a very high confidence. This is a classic example of a poorly calibrated model. I believe your logic should stand, given some careful additional checks are performed for the validity of the confidence scores. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I realize this isn't exactly answering your question, but I think you could provide a sort of empirical uncertainty: Simply use several different text retrieval methods and then report the range of different rankings as your "uncertainty". 
THREAD: To register github account to livelab I followed the guide, but I cannot find my submission.  Later, I found the issue is that: my username and the api key do not match the real ones in github.  After I register a new username (the one used in github) with the API key, it is working well now.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/88c21f81-3e3e-43b2-9640-77a3ae1db8d9/image.png) 
THREAD: Is the coursera grade issue fixed for MP1? I went over the process of cloning the repo again and pushing the changes today. The leaderboard says 1, but there is no update on either the assignment or its corresponding grade on Coursera. I have used the 'Open Tool' option multiple times by now.  How much time does it usually take for the status/grade to be updated on Coursera? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: same here. Do not know the actual reasons REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: ![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%207.18.11%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/524c83b3-4f9a-44c7-ad37-6d0d3001b83e/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%207.18.11%20PM.png)I had this same issue. I was able to resolve it by logging into LiveDataLab and manually linking my Coursera account the same way you link your GitHub account but use your regular password instead of an API token. Then try committing some random change to your code to kickoff the auto grader and you should see the grade reflected on Coursera. At least it did for me. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Does the grade get updated on Coursera immediately or is there a significant lag? I tried doing this but I am not sure if I should expect the grade to be reflected in a few minutes. Also, 'Graded External Tool: MP1' on Coursera still shows 'Started' status. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Mine got updated in Coursera in few mins. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After I manually linked my coursera account, I had to recommit my code to github then LiveDataLab ran its auto grader then once it showed up as green and that I passed it took a minute or two of refreshing coursera before my grade was reflected on coursera REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay. Thanks for the detailed explanation.  Looks like this is not working for me. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Linked my Coursera account in LivedataLab but it didn't work. @TA(s), Need your attention here since there is a hard deadline for the submission and penalty associated. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try using github not the github-dev if you are using that. When I changed the githubs, it fixed the issue for me REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using github only REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What regular password should I input? The password of Coursera account, or the password of GitHub account? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I entered the password to my Coursera account REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since my Coursera email address was my personal email address, I changed it to Illinois email address, opened the tool from Coursera again and pushed the code again to trigger the autograder. I can now see the grade reflecting on Coursera. It looks like the issue was my Coursera login ID was my personal email address earlier. Changing it to Illinois email address seems to have fixed it.

Trying to run ```pip install metapy pytoml``` gives me ```error: Could not find cmake executable```.  If I install cmake with pip, I get ```error: CMake invocation failed```.  Any suggestions as to where to go from here?  __**Solution:**__ Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual  Set up Environment: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: Installing conda on windows and then creating python3.5 virtual environment and then pip install metapy should resolve the issue.   Also see what you are getting if you do  `python --version` from your command line from where you are trying to install metapy. It should return 3.5.0   Regarding installing cmake on windows: you might find this link helpful https://cmake.org/download/ https://cmake.org/install/  Also not everything can be installed by pip..

THREAD: MP 2.1 Code From Sample Script Are we allowed to use the code/functions from the sample script or do we have to write the web scraper completely from scratch? The syllabus says all code should be our own but I wanted to double check (if not the code as is can we modify the functions to work for our specific webpages?). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: I believe if we refer anything that is provided in the sample script from the repo is fine . In the README it says ``` This should help you get started with developing scrapers for other universities' faculty homepages as well. ```  But the recommendation always been write your own stuff by yourself. You can use the sample script to build upon it. I think that is why is it provided and says it will help get started.  TAs, please correct me if I am wrong.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you can use the sample code as reference for your own code and modify it to fit to your webpage want to scrape. 
THREAD: Anki Cards Update Ok, So it turns out campuswire doesn't include people's last name in the "liked" notifications, so I can't send it individually. However, I put the finishing touches on the deck this morning and you can find it here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1027432769  _________________IF YOU'VE NEVER USED ANKI BEFORE READ THIS_____________ Here's how you get Anki (it is free on the web app, Windows, MacOS, Linux, and super cheap on Android. But for some reason, it's like $20 on iOS):  1. Download and install Anki from your phone’s app store and/or from: https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 2. Press “Sync” button and then “sign up” to create a profile (can also sign up on ankiweb.net) 3. Sign in using your email as the username 4. Download the CS410 deck at the following location:        https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1027432769            5. File >> Import  >> *select downloaded deck* 6. Start reviewing notecards within a section after you watch the corresponding lecture videos. (Personally, I would recommend "suspending" all the cards initially so they don't pop up until you've reviewed the lecture material. Then, after you've watched the corresponding lectures, simply unsuspend the notecards in that section). 7. Throughout the semester, keep reviewing older notecards related to previous lectures, even as you start to review new ones. If you review Anki every day, it should take you less than 20 minutes on average 
THREAD: MP1 Invalid File for List Filter I am working through MP1 on the "stopword removal and stemming" section.  I have manually download this file; "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt" from my webbrowser but when I am getting the following error when I try and use in metapy:  tok = metapy.analyzers.ListFilter(tok, "lemur-stopwords.txt", metapy.analyzers.ListFilter.Type.Reject)  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> RuntimeError: invalid file for list filter  Any help appreciated!   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is the file in the same directory from where you are running the code? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Apart from making sure it is in the same directory, please also make sure you did not rename it to anything else when you downloaded it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Definitely a directory issue. It may have gone into your downloads or your home directory by mistake. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See a line before, you may need to manually create a local file. For example, copy the url  to your brower, and copy & paste to a local file. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also make sure that you've downloaded the txt file and not the webpage itself. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I met the same question. I put the "lemur-stopwords.txt" in the Python folder. But it still shows "Invalid file for list filter."   Many thanks for any helps. 
THREAD: MP2.2: implement InL2 model Hello, I was working on MP2.2 and got this feedback.  ``` FEEDBACK: InL2 not implemented correctly!!! ```  I did follow the instructions and build my algorithm according to the formula provided in the README file.  I wonder if there are any test data or other methods that may help me find out the problems in my Ranker object? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you make a private post to TAs and add your code sections, the TAs can help pointing out any issue or tips.   Other than what we have in the MPs I dont think we have any additional test methods, if we want any additional test methods we might want to create by ourselves for testing before submitting it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same feedback. My suggestion is 1) check the return value of your score_one function. There is a default formula and you may need to change it. 2) check if you have optimized the parameter c ```. 
THREAD: Question about MP1 Hi,  I realized that we need to call tok.set_content() every time to set content for the tok. Otherwise, it will be an empty list. Does anyone know why? Thanks. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%207.13.33%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/59cc90a0-6ad0-4f06-a59b-8740453db53c/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%207.13.33%20AM.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 7]: The `tok` object is a Python generator, which is a special kind of iterable that gets "consumed" once to avoid storage. In other words, once we loop over `tok` for the first time, we cannot iterate over it again.  Your second loop `tokens=[token for token in tok]` is looping over an empty iterable that was consumed on the first loop.  There are pros and cons to this. Generators are useful for efficiency where we don't want to store or process the entire collection in memory but rather prefer to process one element at a time.  However, if you are intentionally trying to keep an intermediate copy of the tokens, then the call to `tok.set_contents()` becomes necessary since we have to re-create the token generator object. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Paul！ 
THREAD: MP2.1 browser don't support frame Hi, when I was scraping faculties' personal websites, there are two websites I failed to scrape them.  \ In the file `bios.txt`, the output of these two websites were shown as follow: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1277e41d-5e88-48a5-90de-40153d9fa6ac/image.png) One of them is an empty line, and the other shows that the website uses frame, but my browser doesn't support them. I checked the websites. They both have `frame` tag in the html. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b3fc4409-bd55-4d34-a090-dce621d29405/image.png) I use firefox as my browser. The two websites that cause this error are http://www.physics.umd.edu/dsat/ and http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~yskim  Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It looks like the `<frame>` has been deprecated ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame)) so it's possible that whatever browser is being used doesn't support it anymore.  As to the second part of your question, I believe this is because `<frame>` (like its newer cousin the [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)) makes an asynchronous request at load time to the document specified in the `src` attribute (in your screenshot, one example is `https://ysfine.com/home/hmbot.html`). It looks like this site composes the page using nested frame documents that load up additional documents.   If you follow the `/hmbot` path, you'll see that that loads two `<frame>`s (`/hmleft.html` and `hmright.html`). Following the `hmleft.html` link leads you to https://ysfine.com/home/hmleft.html, which if you inspect the document structure, does show a standard HTML document without `<frame>`s. Scraping this page should return the HTML as you expect it to.  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%2011.16.14%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b23853a9-302b-4c92-932e-7550c30b99ff/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-30%20at%2011.16.14%20PM.png)  You may need to do some preprocessing or add some logic to follow these these `src` links until they reach an "end node" document before being able to grab and parse the text on the page.  Edit: fix grammar REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Your answer is very clear and useful. I really appreciate it! 
THREAD: MP2.1 driver.execute_script error Hi, I got an error when trying to get the html with the function `driver.execute_script('return document.body.innerHTML')`: ```python def get_js_soup(url,driver):       driver.get(url)     res_html = driver.execute_script('return document.body.innerHTML')     soup = BeautifulSoup(res_html,'html.parser')     return soup ``` The error is shown as follows: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/435ff5f8-06e0-445a-93a3-b332ff775a4e/image.png) \ However, this error only occurs when I feed one of the faculties' websites (total 164 websites) into this function. I used my browser (firefox) to access this website, and it seemed okay. Moreover, I found that if I tried to execute this function twice, then this problem could be solved. Like this: ```python def get_js_soup(url,driver):       driver.get(url)     try:         res_html = driver.execute_script('return document.body.innerHTML')     except:         res_html = driver.execute_script('return document.body.innerHTML')     soup = BeautifulSoup(res_html,'html.parser')     return soup ```  Could someone explain why this error occurs, or give me a more elegant solution? Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I ran into this as well and I assume it is because of some asynchronous code where we continue before having the result of a previous line.  Really we would want to await on this code.  Your workaround is one option or you could sleep: ``` !sleep 5 ``` directly after ``` driver.execute_script('return document.body.innerHTML') ``` I moved on before really digging into it.

THREAD: Regarding MP2.3 Hi all,   MP2.3 will be released later since it requires the data from MP2.1 submissions to be compiled and uploaded into the annotation system. We will announce the release of MP2.3 after MP2.1's deadline.  The due time is Sep 26, 2021 at 11:59 pm (CDT) and the hard deadline is Oct 10, 2021, at 11:59pm (CDT).

THREAD: Quiz Deadlines Hello everyone,  The syllabus says that the first couple of quizzes have a hard deadline at week 7 while the grade tab in Coursera for these quizzes have deadlines of the same week. I’m just wondering if there will be penalties applied if quizzes are submitted later than the week it was assigned but before the hard deadline?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, MPs submitted after the due date and before the hard deadline will receive a 50% penalty. Please follow the due dates in the announcement or MP assignment page for full credit.  For instance, if you submit MP1 and get full credit before Sep 5 2021, 11:59pm (CDT), you will receive 100% for MP1. But it will be 50% if you submit between the due date and hard deadline. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/7f9f5206-847b-45f0-a91f-b2dd05c79e2f/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When you say there is a 50% penalty, is that a straight 50% off of the total score, or is the penalty half of the percentage we would have gotten if we had submitted on time? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the late penalty is the 50% of the credit you would actually score.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Austin, Coursera would actually take the submission before the hard deadline and use it as the final score. So it would be 50% off the total score (50% in the end) instead of 50%+0.5%50%=75%. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry for the confusion, please refer to the post on newest quiz policy here: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/885.

THREAD: Config vs code output has different delimiter TLDR: config based filters output has underscore separated trigrams, while code based filters output is a list of tuples with length 3.   The first output is from config based filters, and the second is code based. What could be the reason for this difference? Is there a way we can configure this?

THREAD: Do Inverted Index Construction Use MapReduce?  As seen in the below slide, the construction seems like it could fit a MapReduce model pretty well.

I see it mainly as sorting on the later stages and not any reduction of data. So, I am not sure if map reduce would be a good fit unless you don't do any actual reduction in the reduce phase but just sorting. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If I'm not wrong, the sort described in the slide is a very commonly implemented "External Sort" algorithm. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was thinking of the following approach:  1. map each term_id as <term_id, doc_id, 1> 2. reduce above mapped entries as <term_id: <doc_ids, count>> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Good to know!

THREAD: F-measure parameters Why the answer for this practice question is "Higher"? Can anybody explains   *F-measure contains a parameter that weighs between precision and recall. For an automatic system that filters tweets in the search for possible communication between terrorists about attack plans on US soil, when evaluating the system's performance with F-measure, should we use a higher parameter or lower? *  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Think about the meaning and impact of this parameter. The question has to do with which is more important, high recall or high precision, if you have to make a tradeoff between them.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Keep in mind that this question is assuming that not identifying a terrorist is much much much worse than accidentally identifying a non-terrorist (which I think almost everyone would agree with). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Another way to understand the intuition behind this sort of reasoning would be have a look at the concept of AUC (Area Under Curve). That would probably help you better understand tradeoffs between precision and recall, and their consequences. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Or in medical diagnosis where a false negative in some cases is much worse than a false positive REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am still a bit puzzled by this question. I suppose we don't want to miss out any possible communication. If so, we should prefer high recall instead of high precision, and I would expect the answer to be "Lower" to reduce the effect of precision (and increase the effect of recall) in the F-measure.  Could you please clarify the rationale behind the answer "Higher"?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The practical quiz even has this explanation which matches my rationale:   "Since we would face perils if missing any useful tweets, it is advised to put the emphasis more on recall rather than precision (low precision is less harmful)."  That said, it is unclear why we would use a higher parameter to achieve high recall in F-measure.  
THREAD: Learn CS410 Efficiently with Anki Notecards While watching the CS410 lectures, I made 350+ Anki notecards organized by lecture (Anki is a notecard/memory app). I did this because cognitive science has found that quizzing/testing/doing notecards is the most efficient way to learn. It is better that re-reading or re-watching lectures (If you doubt these claims, you can watch this video I made about it, though it's a bit long: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlu9LnjCXUM)  Anyway, if you want to master the concepts of CS410 in a fraction of the time: ### like this post and I will send you these notecards for free!!

THREAD: Gamma-code log base is 2 Hi, I didn't find this in the slides or the lecture videos, but the log base for gamma-code is 2, not e or 10. I found this confusing at first because I couldn't reproduce the same result as lecture by using log base e or 10. Hope this helps!

THREAD: Python 3.5 installation for metapy Hi Guys,  I am facing issue with the Python 3.5 Installation on MAC ( Big Sur 11.2.2).  Previously I had installed Python 3.9 and was working fine.

THREAD: Success on submission but leaderboard says 0 I submitted MP1 and on LiveDataLab it says success. However the leaderboard says 0 and on Coursera the grade is 0. I did open the assignment through Coursera using the open tool button REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Did you `git push` before or after opening the assignment from Coursera? If you pushed first, you may need to re-push. This worked for me if we're having the same issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also see: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/107  From TA: *We've been in the process of changing some of the leaderboard IDs and project links, so you may have setup the MP with outdated content.

THREAD: Way to change size of subtitles on Coursera  The subtitles block out the notes the professor is displaying many times. Is there a way to resize them? I need them but they are too big. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: You can always download the notes and refer to the PDF when the subtitles are blocking the slide. That’s what I do. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: I dug deeply into this last semester. The only way to do it (unless Coursera changed their displays) is to download the video and play the subtitles in a video program that allows you to avoid overlap. Personally, I ended up using VLC and manually adding black space on the bottom so that I could watch videos white reading subtitles (after downloading all the videos with coursera-dl). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Maybe you can download their videos and the subtitles file and then watch them in other video players. I think some video players allow their users to adjust the subtitles position. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have Firefox, you can use the built-in [Picture-in-Picture](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox) feature to fix the video on your screen. It won't display the subtitles in the video, and you'll be able to scroll down the page and follow the transcript without the video scrolling out of your screen.  ![firefox-picture-in-picture.gif](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6db7dc5f-8f47-4b2d-bdb6-9be9e6fefed6/firefox-picture-in-picture.gif)

THREAD: Proctor Exams Can on-campus students attend in-person exams to avoid the ProctorU exam fees if the Covid is under control? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are not planning to have any in person exams. On campus students should expect ProctorU fees to be covered as part of their tuition, if you're an on campus student you should receive communication near the exam time on exactly how to signup for the exam without paying (or get reimbursed ).

THREAD: Submission not showing up on LiveDataLab submission history I am having trouble getting my submission to show up on LiveDataLab. After I push my code to Github, my submission history and leaderboard remain empty. In the manage webhook recent deliveries tab on Github I noticed that I am getting a response `405 Method Not Allowed`. Anyone know how I can resolve this? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Double check your webhook configuration , the URL and content-type needs to be set properly with Push notification turned on . Once the pipeline works properly, you should be able to see leaderboard ( I'm hoping so ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That did it, thanks!

All of my deliveries have failed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This may be because your GitHub username may not be matching. I had the same issue and then I realized that one of the letters on username was in caps and was causing the mismatch. I removed it and generated the token again and connected again with exact username and it worked.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hello, I am facing similar issue in MP2.4.

THREAD: Minimum IDF value? Regarding the thought exercise posed in the 2.1 lecture about what is the minimum IDF value. Is the answer be that the min IDF value would be represented by log((M+1)/M)? Such that as the number of documents in a collection increases and they all contain the term W, the IDF value would approach 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think your understanding is right and logically if you think a particular word is so common that it does not make any sense to include that in ranking function. In other words, the term is irrelevant from point of view of ranking.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you are right - $$\log(\frac{M + 1}{M})$$ is the minimum possible $$IDF$$ value. But it doesn't depend on the size of the number of documents in the collection. If there's any word $$W$$ which occurs in all documents, then $$IDF(W) = 0$$. 
THREAD: General MP Setup In the MP setup instructions, it says to name each repository <name_of_mp>_private. The example "MP1_private" makes sense.

THREAD: Questions about Quiz Content Hi class,  If you have questions about any content in a graded Quiz, you can post your questions here on Campuswire PRIVATELY (meaning visible only to Instructors and TAs). This rule holds even after the Quiz's deadline since some students will submit their Quiz late.   Questions about Practice Quizzes however can be posted publicly. 
THREAD: Quiz Question Policy Hi, I have some questions regarding the policy for asking quiz questions publicly in this forum. I have seen some posts asking quiz questions here, particularly the graded one, so thinking it might worth clarification.  In some of the earlier courses I have taken, instructors/TAs explicitly disallowed asking graded quiz questions publicly before it is due. Wondering if we have such policy for this course. I am kind of hesitant to answer other students' questions regarding quiz right now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Any post about a graded Quiz's content should be made private. This is true even if the deadline is past. Content of Practice Quizzes is ok to post publicly. 
THREAD: Extra Credit ~5% How can students obtain up to 5% extra credit?    In a few of the introductory lecture videos it said we would be able to do this by interacting with other students and asking questions on Piazza.  However, the Piazza for this class seems to be inactive.    Will we answer questions on Campuswire instead?  And what metric will be used to gauge how much extra credit we earn?   Thanks in advance!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 9]: Since we are posting/answering questions and interacting on Campuswire instead of Piazza, I truly believe everything said regarding Piazza extra credit would be applied to Campuswire instead.  I believe they will take all sorts of statistics into consideration, based on my prior experience for the courses which gave credit based on forum participation. Including but not limited to, questions, answers, upvotes and likes.  Probably they will not announce detailed standards, since it is hard to come up with one and it could negatively impact students just to answer questions in order to meet some certain number. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree with Kefan. Goodhart's law stated simply is “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  With that in mind, I think it's actually important that they don't divulge how the scoring will be done, lest people try to game the system.

Need helps!  **--------------------------------------------------------------Update--------------------------------------------------------------------**  Thanks, everyone. After many attempts, I found the issue was  ``` pip install --upgrade pip ``` If I tried to **upgrade ***pip**,*** the system will generate that kind of errors shown in screenshot. And then the system can not recognize ***pip***, even though with correct path setting.   My guess: the step of upgrading pip causes something wrong that the path would be changed to:  ``` C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\...\\pip-install ``` My python was installed at:  ``` D:\OneDrive....\Python  ``` This error happens in both Python3.9 and Python3.5.   Solution: Not sure how to fix it. However, I choose ***not to upgrade pip*** and install libraries directly. It works with the following warning:  ``` You are using pip version 9.0.1, however version 21.2.4 is available.

It works! Thanks.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The problematic line appears to be `could not find cmake` executable.  There is likely a specific installation method for cmake on your OS. (Try googling / stackoverflow for “how to install cmake on windows).   It may also be a “path” issue where the system cannot find an already installed executable. Adding the file path executable to the system Path  variable would be the resolution. It’s a little different depending on the OS (windows, mac, Linux).

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just curious but in this example for gamma compression of 9 it shows as 1110001 where 1st part is 1110 = 1+floor(log 9) (base 2) = 4 = 1110 in unary 2nd part is 001 = 9-2^floor(log 9) (base 2)=1 = 001 in binary.  In lesson 2.5 the prof says 5 is 11001 1st part is 1110 = 1+floor(log 5) (base 2) = 3 = 110 in unary 2nd part is 001 = 5-2^floor(log 5) (base 2)=1 = 01 in binary.  why is 1= 01 in binary in this example and not 001 like in the first example? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is the number of digits is also based on floor($$log_2x$$). For 9, floor($$log_29$$) = 3 but but floor($$log_25$$) = 2. Therefore, the 2nd part of 5 is 01, not 001. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, I re-posted this in another thread too and someone else gave this similar answer.  
THREAD: Week1 Quiz  Quiz7:  *In VSM model, which of the following will be a better way to measure similarity/distance?*       A: L2 distance:  || v1 - v2 ||_2       B: Cosine similarity:  cos( v1, v2 )   In #88, Bill posted excellent explanation on what's the Cosine similarity and L2 distance.  But not sure ***why Cosine similarity is better than L2 distance***. Many thanks for any sharings. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: so im not sure how much we can talk about actual quiz questions, but hopefully this intuition is appropriate and helpful:   i think one thing that is confusing is that in wk1 we have only talked about representing queries and documents as bit vectors that encode absence/presence of words. Ex. if our vocabulary is ["presidential", "campaign", "news"], both document 1 "...presidential campaign...presidential campaign..." and document 2 "...presidential campaign..." are represented as [1 1 0]. Then cosine and L2 are the same thing  but imagine for a moment if we encoded counts instead: Then document 1 is [2 2 0] and document 2 is [1 1 0].   what is the difference between L2 and cosine now? or, take it to even further extremes and think about comparing vectors [10, 10, 0] and [2, 2, 0] REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: I think both can be used but dot multiplication makes the calculation easier.  - In N-dimensional space, document vector d = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]. Query vector, for example, q = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. With dot multiplication, all dimensions will be cancelled out by 0 except the first one.  - However, with L2 distance, you keep all dimensions in your calculation.

THREAD: Warning... Python 3.5 and PIP upgrading All,  If you read the Readme on the GitHub repo you generate for the first assignment, it will tell you to use Python 3.5 (or 2.7, but not newer than 3.5), and start with the command to update pip, which you will probably run...  I wouldn't recommend that unless you hate yourself.  Pip dropped support for Python 3.5 in January of this year, and now when you try to update to the latest version with 3.5 in your path, you will get an unrecoverable error in the middle of that process, and pip will no longer run going forward because the latest version is written in Python 3.6+ and cannot run in your 3.5 environment.  After a lot of head banging, the solution was eventually found to be simple: install an older version of pip without using the actual pip command (admin mode): easy_install pip==20.3.4  That will recover the maddening .py syntax errors you get any time you try to run any pip command... if you made the mistake of trying to update it while using 3.5. The version of pip I listed above should also work for 2.7 if you're a weirdo who wants to run that.  Even so, pip will continue to passive-aggressively yell at you every time you run a command with a warning that 3.5 is a legacy version that's been deprecated.  You're welcome.

THREAD: Suggestions for setting up conda environment on M1 Macs M1 macs have ARM based compilers running natively, which will NOT install metapy, pytoml by default.  I am writing down a step by step process that I followed to set up my environment using Rosetta + Anaconda.  1) Open Iterm/Mac Terminal using Rosetta. (You can do this right clicking on the application and then "get info"). You may want to create a permanent duplicate, one that works on the M1 chip, one that emulates X_86 using Rosetta. Easier to compartmentalize work. 2) Set up a FULL version of conda, not miniconda or miniforge. The mini versions don't support Python 3.5 as part of their channels. 3) Once you have terminal open with rosetta, create a new conda environment with python=3.5. 4) Continue to install pytoml and metapy. (Use pip and not pip3, as there is only one python version inside your conda environment). 5) Code away!  The M1 is a solid machine but sometimes a bit of a pain for data science libraries. I thought this might come in handy in case anyone is struggling with this.  Cheers!

In Coursera the assignement says "Started", so it knows I've clicked 'Open Tool', but my grade in LiveDataLab is still not transferring to Coursera. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hmm, strange since you pushed and the assignment is "Started". Here's slight variation idea that you might've tried already:  * re-submit the assignment by making a small change/commit and doing another git push     * in my case, I did something like: ``` >>> touch foo >>> git add foo >>> git commit -m "resubmit, added foo" >>> git rm foo >>> git commit -m "resubmit, rm foo from git VC" >>> git push origin master ``` * I'm curious if you had commits on the subsequent re-push attempts. If there are no new commits, git will just say `Everything up-to-date`, (no changes to push) and the grading workflow likely won't get triggered. If you did this already, then please disregard. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Joshua,  We've been in the process of changing some of the leaderboard IDs and project links, so you may have setup the MP with outdated content.  Can you try the set-up from scratch and see if that resolves the issue? Sorry for the inconvenience! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok I can now see some students' grades populated on Coursera, things are working behind the scenes. If you're still running into trouble, try to go through the MP setup again with a fresh copy, might help resolve some issues especially if you pulled the MP much earlier (some things were only resolved yesterday).

The cause of the ambiguity in the original sentence is something called a "squinting modifier", that is, a modifier which could potentially describe 2 or more items in the sentence. The squinting modifier here is "with a telescope", which could modify how the man saw a boy, or it could modify the boy which the man had seen.  Hope this helps, or at least doesn't confuse things more.     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For "L2 distance", I do not remember it is mentioned in Week 1 videos (please correct me if I am wrong). I know this because it was covered in my earlier algebra courses, probably it is also assumed that you would know it as a prerequisite.  Some external resources in case you still need it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance http://www.improvedoutcomes.com/docs/WebSiteDocs/Clustering/Clustering_Parameters/Euclidean_and_Euclidean_Squared_Distance_Metrics.htm REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 8]: cosine similarity is defined as  $$s(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = \frac{\bold{x}\cdot\bold{y}}{||\bold{x}||||\bold{y}||}$$. It is concerned with the angle between two vectors - which follows from the definition of the dot product $$\bold{x}\cdot\bold{y} = ||\bold{x}||||\bold{y}||cos(\theta)$$. So it is just $$s(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = cos(\theta)$$  L2/Euclidean distance you are probably familiar with: $$d(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i-y_i)^2}$$  it is our standard idea of distance.  here's a horrible drawing that may help with the geometry: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a8753732-9298-449b-a58d-cb9f5fea6dd4/image.png)  consider vectors $$x_1, x_2, y$$.  $$x1, x2$$ are in the same direction but the magnitude of $$x_2$$ is slightly longer. Clearly the angle between $$x_1, y$$ and the angle between $$x_2, y$$ are the same, right? But the Euclidean distances to $$y$$, denoted by $$d_1, d_2$$, are different: $$d_2 > d_1$$. So magnitude influences the Euclidean/L2 distance but not the cosine distance, which again only cares about angle REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is just grammar and common sense. There are no clear rules (otherwise the computer can do it easily). If we have another sentence: "A man saw a boy with a girl.", then only one case makes sense. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thank you all for the useful answers to the two posted questions! I'm guessing the question about L2 distance must be a practice quiz question. If you don't know about this concept, please don't worry about it, though I think Bill Guo has given an excellent explanation of it!  In case it's a test quiz question, please do let us know. I haven't covered it in the lecture, so you are not expected to know this for answering any test quiz questions.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree that L2 does depend on vector magnitude in the general VSM. But if we are only using the query terms as BoW vocabulary, then the L2 of query and document vector will be unaffected by document length, right? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yeah true, i think the question was implying a different text representation like tf-idf REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Syntactic structure ambiguity generally means there is more than one way to interpolate the structure of the sentence. As Rongrong said, one case is that "with a telescope" is an attribute of "a boy", and in the other case, "with a telescope" is an adverbial of "a man". Both are correct in grammar, and they are different in structure. How to identify, I think is generally using the knowledge of the language.   For your second question, L2 distance is a geometry/math definition. You don't necessarily need to get it from the VSM model, but the vectors of a VSM model have L2 distances between each.   
THREAD: Regarding installing metapy on Python 3.5 in Win 10 Hello Everyone,   I have been trying to install metapy over Python 3.5 in Win 10.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How exactly are you referencing it in your code?  For example, are you doing the following: ``` import metapy ... metapy.index.Document() ``` I believe you also need the **latest version** of pip, so check that and check that the installation is actually okay. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The moment I type in import metapy, I get the below error.

You have a couple of options now:  - Run the process using rosetta, to emulate x86_64 - Locally build metapy to run on python 3.8 / 3.9. I've created a forked version with the necessary changes here: https://github.com/rajk04/metapy/.

THREAD: Maximum size of group Hi, I wonder what is the maximum size for the project group? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess it is 3 and if more than 3 you have to take instructor approval and the project should be such that you can easily divide work without too much coordination among so many members. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: We originally thought that the maximum size is 3, but given that some of you requested to have a larger group size and we in general encourage you to collaborate with your peers to finish a more impactful project than what you could do with yourself, we have just decided to increase the maximum size to 5.

THREAD: Difference in Grade Breakdown for 4 Credit Hour Students What is the weight of the tech review for 4 Credit Hour students?  This breakdown seems to be only for 3 Credit Hour students.   Percent of Final Grade  Quizzes - 25% Programming Assignments - 25% Course Project - 20% Exam 1 - 15% Exam 2 - 15% REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, the Tech Review (for 4 credit students) will be graded based on completion: if you complete the tech review, then refer to the above for your grade breakdown, if you for any reason do not complete the tech review (or your submission is seriously lacking), then you'll probably receive an email from me or Prof. Zhai to discuss your overall grade in the course (this is bad, you should not want to receive this email). In some cases a grade of "Incomplete" might be granted if all other assignments/work is satisfactory. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So the tech review is only for those taking the 4 credit version of the course? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it doesn't really add anything to 3 credit students (not an extra credit). I'm going to mark this and the previous reply as "tentative" and subject to change up until the Project is released. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For students taking the course for 4 credit hours, if they completed the Technology Review satisfactorily, the weighting scheme would be applied in the same way as those who are taking the course for 3 credit hours. If they failed to complete the Technology Review, their maximum grade would be 75 points (out of 100 points), and the weighting scheme above would be applied to the total 75 points (instead of 100 points). The letter grades are determined based on the following mapping: A+: [95,100] A:  [90,94] A-: [85, 89] B+: [80, 84] B: [75, 79] B-: [70,74] C: [60, 69] D: [55,59] F: <55

THREAD: Semantic analysis of "John owns a restaurant" In slide 8 of lecture 1.1,  the sentence "John owns a restaurant" is shown as an example of what puts precise deep semantic analysis out of reach.  Can someone explain more about why the meaning of the word "owns" is elusive? Off the top of my head, when "own" ends with an "s" and has nouns immediately preceding and following, it's a verb meaning "possesses". There's also the idiom "owns up to" as in "John owns up to his mistakes", but that's an invariant phrase that's easy to distinguish.  Is one issue just that defining "owns" would require too much background knowledge and too many resources to be computationally feasible?

THREAD: Cannot access Google Sheet / faculty directory sign up for MP2 Hello,  I cannot get to this Google sheet. The instructions reference using our university email. I tried that too, but I also get an error due to not having a university accounts through Google. I requested access to my personal email, but this doesn't align with the instructions, so I'm sharing here in case there is a different way that we are supposed to sign up.  Feedback welcome on how to access. Thanks!  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/19f7438b-f8c0-4cc7-b55c-eb292c98adf6/image.png)I    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You probably need to change your email-id to your official educational id for access. You are currently signed in with your personal id. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You might want to register a google account using the university email. But I guess the access is probably not yet granted since there's a month before mp2 is due. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The issue is that I do not have a Google account under my student email. When I try to register normally through Google, there is only an option for @gmail domain.  When I try to sign in to Google using a student email, it says that the account does not exist.  I'm learning that there is a separate campus registration system for Google Apps that is turned off (for me at least) by default. Trying that now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 17]: Thanks folks.  I think the issue is that (some) students need to toggle Google App services through the university cloud services manager. This is separate from how you normally sign up for a Google account.  I was able to access the spreadsheet and my student Google account after the following steps.  ### Steps * Check your student "Cloud Dashboard" here:     * https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/cbdash/ * Toggle Google App Services to "On" * You will be prompted to accept Google Terms & Conditions * You will be redirected to a "Welcome to your Google account" page * Click Next and you will be redirected to Google Drive home page * If you are signed in on a personal account on another tab, you might want to go to Google Sheets, and toggle to switch users in the upper right Google Account menu. The university account should now appear if you followed the preceding steps.    ### Links * Getting Started with Google Apps @ Illinois     * https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=47599 * UIUC Student "Cloud Dashboard":     * https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/cbdash/  Screenshot: *Account Status toggled to off by default* ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ee2a3cfd-be82-4b6d-adbd-802dff3a74f0/image.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks.

THREAD: ProctorU Pricing From the ProctorU section, I just want to confirm that I am reading it correctly that we will need to pay to take the exams?

THREAD: Intuition for building VSM framework Hello everybody! I finished the lectures for Week 1 and I am having some difficulty wrapping my head around the intuition for VSM  I understand that we have a bag of words initialized as a vector, and then we can match a query vector and a document vector against these to produce new vectors comprised of 1's and 0's.  So then, simplified: - Match query vector against bag of words - Match document vector against bag of words - Query vector is all the words in the user query - Document vector is all the words in the document  What I can't seem to understand is this: How do we initialize the bag of words? At 13:16 in Lesson 1.6, this is represented by V   REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 3]: I believe V is the set of all words in all documents, ie. the vocabulary of unique words.  If so, initialization may be: ``` V = {} for d in docs:      V = V.union(set(d.words)) ``` My quick take :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: From my understanding, the bag of words consists of unique tokenized words from the query and the document, which forms the entire vocabulary list V. Each word in V will then be represented as a dimension in the simple initialization of the vector space model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The answers given already explained how to compute V, the set of all the words in a language, which, practically speaking, contains only the words in a collection of documents in our retrieval problem. However, I suspect that your problem might be in thinking that the query vector needs to be *matched* with a "bag of words", which is why you imagine there might be a vector that represents a "bag of words". If so, you need to think about only a query vector or a document vector; we are NOT talking about any other vectors. The words in V define the dimensions of a vector space.  In other words,  your statement "we have a bag of words initialized as a vector" is not correct; there is not such a vector involved.

THREAD: Simplest VSM and Bloom Filter I noticed that they are somewhat similar: both use bit vector, both use hash functions, and both could produce false positives but no false negatives (well, in case of VSM, false positive would mean less relevant document being ranked higher, and false negative would mean relevant document being ranked lower).  Is one inspired by another?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think bloom filters are great for space optimization and for a quick 'not of interest' filter, because as you said, they can get false positives but not false negatives.  I am also curious how locality sensitive hashing relates to text retrieval and VSM REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yep, totally agreed! I was just curious if the two are related :)  
THREAD: Deadline of Course Project Hi, TAs and Professor.  I'm seeing the deadline of course project in Coursera -> Week1 -> course deadlines, but the deadline of project code, project document, and project presentation looks strange to me. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/9529dc8d-4e41-421a-bcf7-b1a969d090cf/image.png) The deadline of submission is after peer review, which seems contradictory.

Thank you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have heard high school level stat and linear algebra should be good enough to get through it.

THREAD: Exam format + note taking Hi, I was wondering if exams would be open-book exams? Also, any suggestion on how to take notes while reviewing the lectures, e.g. should I take detailed notes or just important bullet points?  Thanks! Tony REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 3]: Course introduction video doesn't say anything about open book exams and also from previous students I never heard exams are open book. So I would conclude proctored exams aren't open book.   Regarding notes, each student has their own style of doing things. Do as you feel comfortable for your learning. Although you can download the lecture videos and go through them even when you are offline.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Tony, The ProctorU exams are One to One proctored exams where there is a person on the other end and they take control of your Screen and will ask you to show them your entire room (all the walls, any papers near by, or phone, your desk setup, everything). I am not joking that if you tend to have a habit of thinking and looking here and there, they will literally ask you not to do that as well.. LOL.. SO BE PREPARED FOR THAT !!  Regarding Notes taking... I feel its personal.. But I use a MS One Note and rather than noting down the text... I take screenshots of all the important sections of the Slides while studying and arrange them Week and topic wise. This has helped for studying for the exams.. So i don't have to refer to the the Slides again....  Here is an example of how I write my notes...  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/68522a6a-7e87-4816-b6d2-0e3f97c4841a/image.png)   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For ProctorU, you're also not allowed to think aloud, i.e. talk, during the exam. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Very helpful, thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would recommend using Ipad + apple pencil + Notability app to take notes! It's totally worth it (Although you need to buy all of them). However, you can easily download pdf files as notes into Notability and simply handwrite your notes on them.  Here is my note for example:  ![IMG_30A2008126E8-1.jpeg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/80603e46-8de3-422a-868b-0e0a18af92ff/IMG_30A2008126E8-1.jpeg) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also use OneNote.

Thank you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If I understand, the Due Date column is recommended date to complete the assignment and wont be any penalty if you miss the Due Date (that is more like a soft deadline to keep you go with the pace). The Hard Deadline is what I believe they expect you to complete the assignment for sure.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah you have till the hard deadline to earn some credit, but after it you will receive no credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I saw the below info in "Late Policy" section in "Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar". Should be useful for your info.  "MPs submitted after the due date and before the hard deadline will receive a 50% penalty." "The hard deadline is the deadline after which you will receive 0 points on assignments" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Damn! you are correct. I missed this statement. Thanks for mentioning!  The second date (i.e., 13 Sep) should be ignored for now. It seems this was the due date from last year.  Good discussion though. Thanks everyone. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Per Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar reading under week 1, there will be a 50% penalty if submitting after the due date, and before the hard deadline:   \- Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due at 11:59 p.m. US Central Time on the due date. (Time Zone Converter)  \- MPs submitted after the due date and before the hard deadline will receive a 50% penalty.  \- The hard deadline is the deadline after which you will receive 0 points on assignments regardless how well you did on the assignment. No late submission will be accepted except under extremely rare non-academic circumstances (which usually require approval from the Dean's office).  \- No assignment will be accepted after December 13th. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thanks for your question! We have just updated the deadlines. Please also check information in the orientation part.  For MPs, if you finish after the due time but before the hard deadlines, you will receive 50% of points. If later than hard deadlines, you would get no points. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, Yuxiang! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is the points (the 50%) given the same a minute after the due date (here, 12:00AM on 6 September 2021)  till the hard deadline (here, week 8) or does it go down by a few percentage points each day it's late? Thanks!

Have you tried running through the steps mentioned in this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66482346/problems-installing-python-3-6-with-pyenv-on-mac-os-big-sur/66483524#66483524) / this [github issue](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1740#issuecomment-738749988)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yup. I was looking at exactly that post. I will re-try again.  I ended up successfully installing multiple Python versions using the extra parameters, but I'm not able to launch the interpreter.  For example:  ``` pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % pyenv versions   system * 3.5.10 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)   3.8.11 pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % python3.5 dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python   Reason: image not found zsh: abort      python3.5 pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % python3 dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python   Reason: image not found zsh: abort      python3 ```  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One other option: you can try this with python 3.7, as metapy does seem to run CI against this version: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/commit/1f4318f2c80fa6e8452e27741ed91ba7aa90b5fa REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks. I'll try 3.7 if I can get the interpreter to run. Now it seems that I'm having issues using any Python3 versions.  Trying Miniconda/Anaconda next. They appear to have installers for 3.7, so I'll try that too if my pyenv attempts still fail. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ended up getting the interpreter to run by explicity providing the path to Python executable. Maybe it's my path that's messed up now. A little hacky but it works :)  So rather than this: ``` >>> pyenv global 3.5.10 >>> python3 ``` (which should work), I had to launch python like this `>>> ~/.pyenv/versions/3.5.10/bin/python3`  Example of switching between versions: ``` pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % tree ~/.pyenv/versions -L 2 /Users/pzuradzki/.pyenv/versions ├── 3.5.10 │   ├── bin │   ├── include │   ├── lib │   └── share └── 3.8.11     ├── bin     ├── include     ├── lib     └── share  10 directories, 0 files pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % ~/.pyenv/versions/3.5.10/bin/python3 --version Python 3.5.10 pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.11/bin/python3 --version Python 3.8.11 pzuradzki@Pauls-MacBook-Pro ~ % ~/.pyenv/versions/3.5.10/bin/python3 Python 3.5.10 (default, Aug 21 2021, 17:41:11) [GCC Apple LLVM 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> print("yow" + "!"*20) yow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Update - I got pyenv to work normally. There were some pretty estoreic shell configurations in the ReadMe that I missed/didn't understand at first.   Confirmed that I can launch Python3.5 and toggle between versions using pyenv and just the `python` launch command.  Here is what my .zshrc looks like if it's of use to anyone running Big Sur on Mac: ``` # ~/.zshrc  # Conda initializer stuff # >>> conda initialize >>> # !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !! __conda_setup="$('/Users/pzuradzki/opt/miniconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)" if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then     eval "$__conda_setup" else     if [ -f "/Users/pzuradzki/opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then         . "/Users/pzuradzki/opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"     else         export PATH="/Users/pzuradzki/opt/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"     fi fi unset __conda_setup # <<< conda initialize <<< CONDA_AUTO_ACTIVATE_BASE=false  ##### #####  # Big Sur fixes for pyenv (multiple Python version support) installed via Homebrew # references: required shell configurations, https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv # StackOverflow: envs variables suggestion, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66482346/problems-installing-python-3-6-with-pyenv-on-mac-os-big-sur/66483524#66483524 eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)" export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/bzip2/lib" export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/bzip2/include" eval "$(pyenv init --path)" ```  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That sounds great! Thanks a lot for sharing your shell configuration :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have attempted these steps and am still unable to install and run python on my machine. I hav MacOS Big Sur. Is it possible for me to get help from a TA in office hours? If so, when would be the best time? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I have a mac and the package management is so awful, I always do my technical work in a linux vm  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried a VirtualBox VM, but it felt a bit laggy and awkward to develop in (4gb RAM for VM). If you’ve had a good experience developing with another VM on Mac, I’m curious to hear what else is out there.  I’m happy with pyenv now that it’s working but - ouch - that was painful at first. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Paul, MeTA *should* work with Python 3.x.... did you try just using the default Python you have? Are you running into trouble installing MeTA then? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Assma. This is resolved for me. I ended up getting pyenv to work. There’s more detail on my steps in the other Replies. I think this Feed/Thread may have been marked as unresolved because other students may still be having issues with getting the Python 3.5.  For context to other students maybe reading, pyenv let’s you switch versions of Python more seamlessly especially if you already have pre-existing installations. Course docs suggest Python 3.5 and it looks like metapy’s continuous integration is tested up through Python 3.7 for Mac. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I originally did have trouble pip installing metapy using Python 3.9 on Mac OS Big Sur.   I ended up getting pyenv to work (a separate messy packaging issue for newer Mac OS) and now I can toggle to Python 3.5.  I don’t think I tried using system Python (2.7) because I’m paranoid to mess around with my OS :). It probably would work if I installed 2.7 with pyenv but it’s no longer necessary for me. 
THREAD: Week 1 Project Overview + Tech. Review Readings Locked? I already read through these but wanted to check back and reread.  They are currently locked for me:  ![locked.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/41c935ee-a3e6-49b0-84c3-8d8604b09c1c/locked.png)  Are changes being made? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: it is locked for me too REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are still working on those pages and will make them available soon. There  is no task from either the Course Project or the Tech Review due any time soon, so please don't worry about missing any important information. In general, please ignore any pages that are not visible to you at this point.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: These appear to be available now REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is available now.. 
THREAD: Question on Tech Review  I am referring the following section under syllabus page : *Tech Review (for 4-credit students). It will require you to generate a short 1-2 page review on an interesting course-related cutting-edge technology topic not covered in any lecture.*  What is the significance on mentioning *for 4-credit students* in the bracket ? Is this an optional activity for some students ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 4]: Students that are registered for this course are either in a 3 or 4 credit hour section. I believe the that graduate students (those who are either enrolled in an online MCS or on-campus MS/MCS) are registered for the 4 credit hour sections, whereas undergrads register for the 3 hour section.   Tech review is required for students in the 4 hour section, but is not required for students in the 3 hour section. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ok, thanks Jackson  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Does the review count for our final grade?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Based on the following input, its now I believe  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5afd7ed2-1ca0-478d-b6aa-69908a00d6e5/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The review will be graded as "pass" or "fail" and is mandatory for students who are taking this course for 4 credit hours.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Actually I just saw the post, the technology review will be added in our final grade, if we fail to achieve this then our grading will be based on 75 points max, like maximum we will be able to achieve 75 points if technology review is not there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Should we sign up for the topic we picked? If so, where is the sign up sheet? 
THREAD: Dark Mode Campuswire has dark mode! Left-click your username/icon in the bottom left to access the dark mode toggle. 
THREAD: Conditional Entropy I understand that having extra information about whether another word with a syntagmatic relation can help us improve the accuracy of our probability estimate (i.e:  $$p(X_{meat}) \geq p(X_{meat}|X_{eats})$$  But I don't understand how that can lead to necessarily lower entropy. To me, it seems entirely possible that we have a marginal probability: $$p(X_{meat}) \approx 0.01$$ for a given text.   At the same time, we might get a conditional probability like the following: $$p(X_{meat}|X_{eats}) \approx 0.5$$  Now in this case, I understand that having the extra information about "eats" leads us to have a more accurate representation of the probability of "meat" occurring, but if $$p(X_{meat}|X_{eats}) \approx 0.5$$ , then doesn't this have a much higher entropy than the marginal probability? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: How can the probability of event A occurring be less than the probability of A occurring and B occurring?  I'm not sure but take a look at: https://brilliant.org/wiki/conditional-probability-distribution/ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In this case, these are conditional probabilities, not joint probabilities, so it's definitely possible for a marginal probability to be higher or lower than a conditional probability (depending on the event in question).    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I misread your question! Hrm.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I figured it out: I believe the Conditional Entropy slide is incorrect: the example conditional entropy calculation on this slide does not agree with the formula on the next slide.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/410c8c4a-b0ce-4495-a61d-1bc2b1034ef3/image.png)   Wikipedia also has a very readable equation for the conditional entropy in many different forms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy  $$H(Y|X) = \sum_{x\in \mathcal X, y \in \mathcal Y} p(x,y) \,log\frac{p(x)}{p(x,y)}$$  or  $$H(Y|X) = - \sum_{x\in \mathcal X, y \in \mathcal Y} p(x,y) \,log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$$  In other words, the log of each conditional probability needs to be multiplied by the joint probability NOT the conditional probability. (Or you could multiply the log of the conditional probability by the conditional probability and the marginal probability of the conditioning event, but that just seems complicated.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No worries :D

Will reach out to mcs-support. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For reference, I'm an undergrad taking this class, so it might be that at current only MCS students have access. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I figure out the reason. After completing the Onboarding course, 6-12 hours are needed for registered course to appear on the Coursera. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Wait so do I actually need to do the onboarding course?
