THREAD: Can anyone recommend Windows software to record a demo? I haven't done this before. Thanks! REPLY: Slack video recording. Zoom session with recording. Windows 10 Utility - Xbox Game Bar REPLY: OBS Studio REPLY: OBS Studio, too. I tried several recording tools, but each had own issues(Microphone, bit rate setup, and others). Only OBS Studio worked perfectly in my environment. 
THREAD: Do we have quiz questions from chapter 7 to chapter 12 collected anywhere? REPLY: You can retake them in Coursera  
THREAD: 20 question test that you have an hour to complete. If you didn't have issues finishing the first test you won't have issues finishing this one. If you can do all the quizzes well without notes, you're practically guaranteed a good score. REPLY: Thank you! The test covers week 7-12 right? Nothing from week 1-6? REPLY: Nothing from 1-6 
THREAD: To help in our preparation for the second exam, I used what I learned in this course in terms of scraping, data cleaning and text summarization to create <https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/gunther6_illinois_edu/EvC5Rwh9g69CnsnJn48-oqcBy5bbwPHHu0ss2p-ZRYJq6g?e=1B4xyu|HERE> the six documents below: •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Slides consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Slides consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) For curiosity and if you have interest in summarization (I have a lot), I used a rate of 35% (I tried with lower numbers, but the experience was not so good). This was a good exercise. I tried different extractive and abstractive summarization algos, including some packages already available in Python and pre-existing models. Abstractive is the future, specially the different HuggingFace Transform algorithms, but it requires much more study, analysis, and tuning to find the right parameters for big text such as transcripts (it would be a good exercise after the exams). After testing different extractive options I decided to use a step by step process using NLTK and PageRank: pre-processing, word and sentence embedding, padding, similarity matrix, cosine distance and PageRank for the sentences. Feel free to provide feedback about the summarized results. REPLY: I'm curious about a few things.  1) Are the transcripts un-edited, i.e. straight from Coursera? 2)  Does the summarization make new statements, eliminate redundant statements in the transcripts, or something else? 3) Do the summaries still follow the sequence of slides? REPLY: Follow my comments: 1-) Yes  2-) it is an extractive algorithm. With giant texts such as transcripts I got better results (so far) using extraction instead of abstractive (generating new sentences)  3-) Yes, it follows the sequence of slides REPLY: Hopefully someone has extra time to give you feedback. REPLY: <@U016V2VURUH> I took this class a couple years ago and my final project was also based on summarisation :slightly_smiling_face: . I had used TextRank which is based on PageRank for extractive summarisation. Also, you are right, for longer texts extractive approaches give better results but its also dependent to some extent on the datatset. I am in NLP at the moment writing a HW review paper on the recent advances in abstractive summarisation. REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0> this is a great topic and I am interested to learn more.

THREAD: I realize it’s a bit late, but is anyone interested in joining my project? It’s an active problem I’m working on at my job in collaboration with a team of student interns and open-source contributors.  1 page overview: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eyat5Aw6uPloQH8svH2M-g3fH3hH6UgXtxoojTL7pH0> Petal taxonomy: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840249663797723146/859519135313690664/PeTaL_Taxonomy_v1_Dec_2020v2.png> Github: <https://github.com/nasa-petal> Project proposal: <https://github.com/nasa-petal/search-engine/blob/main/proposal.docx?raw=true>  Project Description: Build an information system for the following problem: How to identify biology papers that describe various biomimicry functions from a known list of 100 functions, and rank them in order of relevance to a particular biomimicry function. An example would be a paper describing how geckos feet enables them to cling to surfaces, should be given a high relevancy rank for the biomimicry function, “attach temporarily”.  We’ve tried a couple of text-classification approaches to the problem, and have a simple web UI setup, but the goal of this project would be to explore some of the text retrieval and mining approaches to the problem to see if we can achieve better relevancy of results. If we have enough time/people it would be nice to add a feedback piece using implicit feedback of clickthrough data. REPLY: Hey Brandon, I would be interested in joining your project. I’m in PST. would that work? REPLY: Great, I’m in EST but my schedule is pretty flexible, so we can probably make it work.

Did people not review the study guide, or was the study guide irrelevant to the test? REPLY: I haven't taken the exam yet.. REPLY: yeah this should not be done while exam is not yet over. add more pressure to others REPLY: I just finished the exam. It makes sense the exam score distribution.  1. The weekly quizzes are really helpful. The exam is not far from the quizzes. But, you should be able to explain why incorrect items in questions are incorrect as well. In my opinion, the exam is asking whether you really understand the quizzes.  2. Understanding models is really important. You do not need to memorize all formulas, but should understand how they work and the meaning of parameters. Questions will challenge you if you cannot interpret them.

THREAD: The probability of A OR B is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of B because terms are mutually exclusive, I think. REPLY: yeah Mat, agreed. as per the answer this statement is not correct. trying to think why this can be incorrect, because if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect. REPLY: <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1082> 
THREAD: any idea why is this correct? REPLY: Yea. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) REPLY: makes sense Rahul. if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect I guess. REPLY: In Uni-gram model, A and B are *independent events,* *not mutual exclusive event*.  *[Independent event]* If A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). For example, what you eat this morning is independent to what score you get in this exam, so P("you eat fish this morning and you get score 100") = P("fish") * P("score 100").  *[Mutual exclusive event]* if A and B are mutually exclusive event, A and B cannot happen at the same time. For example, P("today is Wednesday and today is Friday") = 0.  The first statement is true because in Uni-gram model, A and B are independent events. For example, in Uni-gram model, P("today is Wednesday") = P("today") * P("is") * P("Wednesday") = P("today Wednesday is"), so we don't care about the grammar or context.  The third statement is false because you need to subtract P(A and B). Assume that P(A) = 0.6, and P(B) = 0.5, if you don't subtract P(A and B), then P(A or B) would be 1.1, which is greater than 1. REPLY: Makes so much sense. Thanks <@U020GEPFQ7Q>  REPLY: no problem! REPLY: in unigram model p(w1)+p(w2)+...+p(wn) = 1 so P(A)+P(B) can't be bigger than 1 like 1.1 in your example REPLY: You’re right, thanks! Maybe P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3 would be a better example. P(first word is A or second word is B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.12. And P(first word is A and second word is B) = 0.4*0.3 REPLY: If the third statement is asking when you generate only one word, what is the probability that this word is A or B, then I think the third statement is true. Because in this case, event 1(get A in the first word) and event 2(get B in the first word) are mutually exclusive. So the probability would be P(get A in the first word) + P(get B in the first word)  I think the statements of this question is not clear enough and I’m little confused.

THREAD: I found myself getting a little depressed going through the Recommender Systems content. Nowadays, this is the technology that's being used to push conspiracy theories, quack cures, teenage self-harm, and other nonsense designed to break society.  Can anyone recommend links on ways this can be combatted? For example, are there recommender systems that are driven by more than just user clicks and ratings? What other criteria might they use? REPLY: Sorry, I don't have a good resource for you, but glad you're bringing up this ethical concern. Where do you think the responsibility belongs to address these concerns? Personally, if we say everyone is individually responsible (or for their kids), then I suspect nothing will be done unless it impacts someone's bottom line. REPLY: That's a great question. I'm not nearly as up on ethics as I should be.  Humans naturally seek communities, and a great way to make money is to point them to things they're already interested in. I wonder if some recommendations could be driven not only by clicks but by some measure of "high information content" plus "neutral sentiment". I bet few people would follow those recommendations, though.  For now, I'm curious to see how Facebook's Instagram issues will play out. Will there be lawsuits or legislation, and what effect would it have? My thought is "not much", but we'll see. REPLY: This would make for a good campuswire post. I'm sure the TAs and professor would be able to point to decent resources. REPLY: That's a good idea, thanks. I will.  I attended a session on AI ethics a while back. The speaker listed ethical principles that have a lot of overlap with the principles of human-subject research. For example, give your subjects information about the data you plan to collect on them, and allow them to opt out.  One new principle was model transparency. I don't remember if this applies to general model explainability, or the ability to show a user why a model recommended them a particular item.  In any case, the principles give the user the choice about what to participate in. But with things like recommendation systems there's an additional risk of encouraging addictive behavior. People rarely have uncontrollable cravings to participate in research studies, but giving someone a chance to get lost in echo chambers is much more enticing. I think any approach to addressing issues has to recognize there's an addictive component to current systems. Of course, if that's the component that makes companies money, it's going to take a lot more work to address meaningfully. REPLY: Let me start by saying, I love this discussion!!!! It's so easy to get into the weeds of solving problems, but not so much about the repercussions thereafter. Here is my rambling train of thought on the above.  The opt-in opt-out is probably the most simple solution to any system. Use my data, no don't use my data.... a sign in the front of the store, that says, smile, you're on camera... (e.g. amazon go stores). don't like the convenience, no problem, you can still go to WholeFoods.  Echo chambers are a real threat to citizenship, some countries may prefer it (e.g. China), but what makes sense for a free speech society. when is too much of a good thing (e.g. content I like) a bad thing. Let's say I like watching a particular genre of TV/Movie to the point of Binge watching. Should Netflix be forced to limit my subscription? Or is it enough to provide an on screen widget that tells me my viewing habits. (e.g. hours this week per show / genre, etc). Probably the latter could still make me watch less, but would it make me cancel my subscription, maybe? REPLY: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFRewkdDT2g> REPLY: I think it's also important to note that these positive feedback systems are creating echo chambers no only online in social media, but in any opinion-oriented medium. And not just explicitly opinion-based websites: look into Larry Sanger's (one of the founder's of Wikipedia) opinion on what the politically-oriented articles of Wikipedia have become). News websites (even formerly reputable ones) and social networks all drive people toward the same conclusion: people seeking confirmation bias because it feels good. From alcohol/drugs, to sex, to calorie-dense fatty/sugary foods, all the way to confirmation bias, our own primal desires push us to overindulge in these behaviors.  Specifically regarding the low-cost driven echo chambers: I suppose in past generations, the extent to which group-think was able to persist was primarily a function of the size of groups and cost of communication between potential members. Now that the cost of finding people who think exactly like you do is essentially zero, I don't know how possible it is to avoid the fractionating.  Another consideration I've thought about: to what extent is it moral to make people do something that they don't want to do, just because you think it will be better for them? Obviously most smokers are addicted to cigarettes and we know they would be healthier (and better off financially) if they didn't smoke. Does that mean it's moral to make them stop? I'm not entirely sure I know how to answer that question, but the similarities between that question and the question of regulating feedback systems is noteworthy. REPLY: Re: echo chambers, I thought Ground News’ curated “Blindspot for the Left/Right” concept was interesting in pushing up news stories that you’re less likely to see depending on political lean.  <https://ground.news/blindspot|https://ground.news/blindspot>  I used to follow pundits that I disagree with on Twitter thinking it would help with filter bubbles, but I don’t think this is a good approach anymore. Too noisy. REPLY: <@U012ZBEMAKW> specifically regarding "conspiracy theories", I'm very reluctant to think that it is a good move to stop any idea in particular because of one main issue: who decides what is a "conspiracy theory" and what isn't?  Remember when Covid definitely had a natural origin? (even though any honest actor knew the lab leak hypothesis was a plausible explanation all along). Remember when Iraq definitely had nuclear weapons? Remember when Assad definitely gassed his own people?  I could go on and on and on with dozens of major examples, but my point is pretty simple. Sometimes the difference between a conspiracy theorist and an unorthodox thinker is a few years passing. To think we've reached our zenith as humanity and that the intellectual elite will never be wrong about something in the future is naive. Preserving the ability to speak out--even if it is "conspiracy theories"-- is a necessity.  And perhaps more importantly, do you really trust big brother to never have incentives misaligned to the point that the person or group deciding whether something is "true" or not might have something to hide or a financial stake to buttress?  I know I don't. We have anti-pollution laws that have teeth specifically because we realize that the desire to keep you job and become more successful professionally is a strong incentive that has to be counteracted with a stronger punitive policy. In the same way, we should expect that the "fact-checkers" can have misaligned incentives at least occasionally.  There's a reason that the protection of free speech in the first amendment. REPLY: <@U028YQ2C0T1> I use ground news semi-frequently! I think it's a great resource! I especially think the most obvious bias becomes obvious looking at their website: omission bias. Looking at the different sides of the political aisle covering different things (e.g. team red covering the increase in illegal immigration and team blue covering the capital riot) makes the bias pretty obvious in totality. It makes you realize that there are (at least) two different realities emerging, predominantly brought about by the fragmentation of new coverage. REPLY: Maybe this rule is best: my freedom ends where harm to you begins.  As far as recommender systems go, the Instagram case seems like a good fit to this rule. Children don't have the same type of agency as older people, and Facebook appeared to know their product increased the risk of self-harm and other ill effects.  For adults, maybe the best thing is just to understand what companies use recommender systems to do: keep you clicking on their content as much as possible, no matter what. But that's easy not to think about, and so the US has quick spread of ideas like taking ivermectin for COVID or that voter suppression is needed to fight nonexistent mass voter fraud. (Voter suppression should count as infringement of free speech, if it doesn't already).  The case of Iraqi WMDs is an interesting one. The IAEA had found no evidence of Iraq reviving a nuclear program, but by that point the US media had echo-chambered itself into support for war. No Youtube needed!  I'd like to hear more about what issues other countries face. But now I'll stop breaking my rule to avoid politics in non-political forums. REPLY: I completely agree that children don't have the same agency as adults, but I don't know how reasonable that rule is for adults when the adults being harmed in this situation are consenting to the "harm." At least currently, that rule is inconsistent with how society treats other products (e.g. cigarettes, alcohol, fast food, etc). REPLY: but yes, I would be curious to hear the opinions of some non-Americans!

THREAD: Important announcement by Prof. Zhai in Campuswire pinned post yesterday regarding  change in policy for quiz deadline and penalty.  ```Dear All,   My apologies for the confusion caused by conflicting information in the new Late Quiz Penalty Policy post here and one of the TA answers in a previous question about Quiz penalties.   The confusion has mostly come from the somewhat different policies that we were expected to use for the online MCS students and the on-campus students in the mixed class. Historically, in order to accommodate the unpredictable schedules of our online MCS students, the department suggested removing all the late penalties for quizzes as long as the work was submitted before a "hard deadline". However, such a policy does not help students plan their work, often causing accumulation of too much work at the end. Moreover, it's also not the typical policy that has been applied to our on-campus students, which can cause confusion.   Thus we decided to revise the policy and give an "incremental penalty" for late submission of quizzes, which can help avoid too much work being potentially accumulated right before an exam.  Meanwhile, we still would like to do as much as we can to accommodate those who might have an expected challenge that would prevent them from finishing a quiz (or an MP) on time by granting extensions in a case by case manner. So if you have encountered any unexpected challenge or interruption in your study that affects your capacity of finishing a quiz or MP on time, please do request an extension by posting a "private note" on campuswire with an explanation of your situation.   Unfortunately, I didn't communicate clearly with all the TAs about this. Sorry for this confusion.   Due to this confusion, we will not enforce the New Late Quiz Penalty for Quizzes 1 through 4; for those quizzes you can still submit your quiz and receive full credit up to the Hard Deadline (end of Week 7).   For Quizzes 5 onward, however, the New Late Quiz Penalty Policy will be enacted: if you submit your quiz before the item deadline on Coursera, no penalty is deducted. If you submit your quiz after the item deadline but before the Hard Deadline, a daily penalty of 5% will be deducted. Please note that this new Late Quiz Penalty Policy only applies to Quizzes! The MP Late Penalty will NOT change, it will remain 50% penalty after the deadline.   Thanks,   -Cheng``` REPLY: I'm still confused over this, does this mean we get penalized when we submit after the hard deadline (week 7)? Also we are currently in week 5, it would make more sense to let this be effective starting from quiz 6 onwards 
THREAD: <!here> if you agree to not have the deadline of quizzes and MPs on the same week as lecture and prefer 1-2 weeks after, please :+1: on my post on <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/795>  Thanks.

THREAD: I completed the first week of Text Retrieval and Search Engines. How can I transfer this progress over to the for credit CS410: Text Information Systems course on coursera? REPLY: I just clicked through and skimmed everything and took the quiz. REPLY: I don't think it's possible to transfer the quiz grades. REPLY: I see, thanks REPLY: As David mentioned, you can't really transfer, but the videos are the same. You'll have to re-take the quizzes. REPLY: Allegedly you can contact Coursera and they can transfer it over (though I haven't tried it). But I ask you this. Which is more difficult: retaking a few quizzes or trying to get customer support to do an uncommon operation? REPLY: The guidance in the onboarding course is not super specific. It's in Week 2 "Progress Migrations" module. It says that you are welcome to re-submit but it does not look like there is an automatic transfer or anything. Might be worth asking MCS Support to clarify.  &gt; _If you decide to enroll early, you will be in a public course open to the entire Coursera global learning community. A student can complete one or both Coursera MOOC courses prior to  completing the Online MCS for-credit course. Any assignment that was  only peer or auto-graded for a previous Coursera MOOC version of a  course can be re-submitted when taking the Online MCS offering of the  course for consideration by the faculty and staff to satisfy the  requirements to confer university credit.  However, for-credit course  content may be revised and updated for course improvement, making  previously completed MOOC assignments no longer compatible with the  degree requirements.  In such instances, students will be required to  complete the current assignments to fulfill requirements for the  for-credit course they are enrolled._ <https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcsds-orientation/supplement/w6l9Q/progress-migrations> REPLY: <@U029JEHM6MA> I looked through a few of the quizzes, and they seem to have different questions, so I doubt you can now transfer over quizzes, even if you used to be able to. REPLY: <@U029JEHM6MA> any another pro-tip: you only have to watch the last 5 seconds of a coursera video to get the green checkmark (watched video status) next to the video (not having a full column of green check marks always irritates me lol) REPLY: Thanks everyone. Yeah I think it's easier to just speed through everything by hand.

First, here is another student's perspective: <https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/kd9uj0/review_of_cs_410_text_information_systems_fall/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share|https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/kd9uj0/review_of_cs_410_text_information_systems_fall/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share> REPLY: I mostly agree with this. The course is exceptionally well-structured, and covers the basics of both Text Retrieval (searches) and Text Mining. I recommend it.  I took it in conjunction with AML, and had no problem keeping up in both classes. 410 took probably 8 - 10 hours per week on average. REPLY: Paul Nel graduated in 2019, but he tracked every minute he spent in every class, and for 410, he spent just over 120 hours total, which averages out to a little over 7.5 hours per week.  So that's roughly in line with what I spent on it. REPLY: Thanks Bob! I appreciate your input. REPLY: <@U013T91B259> I am searching for reviews on Data Curation and Scientific Visualization as well. If you have any links for those, could you please share them too? REPLY: I don't really have anything much on those.  You can search that subreddit (<https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/>) and see if there's anything in there.   In general, I know that Sci Viz contains some pretty serious difficult math as part of the 3D visualizations -- it's more of an advanced graphics course.  Data Curation is supposed to be a low-stress, low-workload class that you can pair with just about anything else. 
THREAD: I mean after adding the extra credit points (coursera doesn’t include those) REPLY: In Coursera, under Achievements: Other Completed Courses, you'll find Grade Achieved in percentage points. REPLY: I mean after adding the extra credit points (coursera doesn’t include those) 
THREAD: See the grades in self service but not the Coursera certificates under accomplishments. Anyone got their certificates ? REPLY: See linked post in linked message below: <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C1XHW0MNJ/p1608817256263000?thread_ts=1591030338.354500&amp;cid=C1XHW0MNJ> REPLY: There won’t be any course completion certificates for CS410 and is confirmed by TAs. However, I’m unsure if this applies to the entire UIUC degree. 
THREAD: its updated for me but how to check percetage? REPLY: Overall GPA is given in the *TRANSCRIPT TOTALS* section. 
THREAD: Current term gpa and cumulative gpa is not updated for me. Is it the same for others too? REPLY: Same with me. Shows the GPA for the course, but doesn’t show the Current Term, Cumulative, Overall GPA in the summary table. REPLY: I’ve sent an email to mcs-support. I believe the university is closed from tomorrow onwards. Let’s see what they are going to respond. REPLY: Those GPA have updated now. 
THREAD: Should be in exactly 41 minutes :smile: at least in undergrad I was able to view grades in self service after the reporting deadline. REPLY: Grades are still not out 
THREAD: Where can we see that in the accomplishments? I see, no certificate offered for this course REPLY: I meant to say that the overall grade is updated. REPLY: is there a place to see the overall grade? REPLY: You can see the overall grade in accomplishments. Accomplishments is in a dropdown menu when you click your account name in the top right of the page. I found my grade towards the bottom of the apge REPLY: Does anyone know if extra credits are supposed to be part of the percentage seen on the 'Accomplishments' page... or are they reflected separately in the transcripts eventually? REPLY: <@U018DNRNV1C> <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1561|https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1561> REPLY: Thanks for the pointer, <@U013S23JMM0>. Response in the post: "They will be included in the final grade on your transcripts." 
THREAD: Anyone know when the grade for the course project will be released? REPLY: Official last date for score release is on 23rd. We can expect it anytime before 23rd. 
THREAD: What is 510 pls? REPLY: I too wish the same.. How about we do a survey and approach department? REPLY: What is 510 pls? REPLY: I believe it’s the 500-level course that expands on 410 (this class) REPLY: Would highly consider taking this. REPLY: <http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/510f18/info.html> <@USY4KEN1E> REPLY: Yeah, shall we also email the instructor to ask if he's willing to offer this course? <@U0123GXQ9S6> REPLY: <http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/510f18/info.html> REPLY: Looking at the details in the link <http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/510f18/info.html> it doesn’t look much different of this course frankly

THREAD: Did anyone downloaded the videos for this course? Can it be shared? REPLY: i think the videos are probably the same as the public MOOC... REPLY: It depends on the prof. If it's already publicly available, it's probably ok. But some professors dislike you sharing material that they put a lot of effort into creating. You should probably ask just in case. 
THREAD: For the review, is it enough to edit and save it? Is there anything like a submit action? REPLY: I edited and saved my existing review.  I don't think there's anything else? REPLY: Correct. The post below confirms this: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1508> 
THREAD: Congrats to the top-rankers! :tada:   From Bhavya in Piazza:    Dear students,  Here are the final leaderboards for the IR competition and the Text Classification competition. We took the max scores per team to determine the ranks. The "Score (out of 45)" column is the score computed as per the formula stated in the project guidelines. The "Score for CMT" column should be used by the reviewers for answering question 4 in the reviewer form on CMT. We've also added links to these spreadsheets in Q4 on CMT.  Please let me know if your submission is missing from the spreadsheets or if your scores are not correct.   Congratulations to everyone on the great work, especially the top-rankers!!  #pin REPLY: what CMT 10 score means and any additional score for top rankers? REPLY: CMT 10 is for the source code, this is equivalent to 45% of project total score. In addition to that, top-ranker will get 10% as extra point for beating the competition baseline. 
THREAD: For the ones who took competition project, in the final submission along with documentation and code do we have to submit the answer.txt as well? REPLY: Yes.  I submitted answer.txt. My demo code/videos is basically to re-generate the answer.txt using the trained model. By submitting my answer.txt, I hope it will be easier for the reviewer to follow along with the demo code/video. REPLY: I think TA mentioned in one of the question that you can keep the answer.txt in your private repo and everything else in public repo. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=993|@993> REPLY: As ranking is already out hence answer.txt can be checked-in to public repo REPLY: Thanks your inputs guys, will check with TA if it’s allowed to submit the file now as the deadline is already over 
THREAD: Anyone working on the EducationalWeb system and able to get the "Explanation" section (on a word) to even show up? REPLY: No, didn't work for us either... 
THREAD: anyone here was able to get *ExpertSearch* to run successfully locally? I'm banging my head against the wall on this one! The dependencies have multiple conflicts with each other and `metapy` is not available for *Python 3.8* REPLY: <@UM44LTPJM> I was able to get this running on my Mac. I used the Python 2.7 version of pip to install the dependencies, but I needed to explicitly choose which gunicorn I wanted: ```/Users/mpigott/Library/Python/2.7/bin/gunicorn server:app -b 127.0.0.1:8095``` 
THREAD: Anyone remember how to solve the following (Q9, #2). I never figured out the wording and I dont see anything on piazza REPLY: Think of this like a decision tree.  Step 1 is choose a model (1 or 2).  Then choose the probability of the words coming from that model. REPLY: (probability of choosing model 1)(probability of choosing word 1 in model 1)(probability of choosing word 2 in model 1) + (probability of choosing model 2)(probability of choosing word 1 in model 2)(probability of choosing word 2 in model 2) REPLY: That is the answer/solution to the first question in this set I thought REPLY: That one is that formula, but that isnt the solution for #2 REPLY: Sorry, I took the exam on Nov 23rd and this is fuzzy now REPLY: No worries, i dont think i ever figured out what the TAs/Professor was even asking in this question. REPLY: Try this: (Probability for Model 1) * (Word 1 probability for Model 1) + (Probability for Model 2) * (Word 1 probability for Model 2) REPLY: Then multiply that quantity against the equivalent quantity for Word 2 REPLY: Ah! There we go, I understand what they are asking now REPLY: Hopefully that gets you the right answer!  I think the concepts were explained more thoroughly in the first half of the course REPLY: Very strangely worded. REPLY: As I said, I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think that's the right answer REPLY: It is. THe question was just worded weirdly imo REPLY: Yay! REPLY: my brain needs to solve these questions thinking on either topic mining where docs are generated sampling from many topic models, Or clustering where we need docs generated from only one topic model. Then I decide where to add p(theta) in the formula. REPLY: Not sure if this comes too late considering today is end for final, the Exam 2 guide by TAs has good explanation or atleast how to arrive at the solution. 
THREAD: I am confused by the grading criteria for the final project. On Coursera it says the majority (~90%) is graded on completion. But when i asked TA, he/she answered otherwise… Does anyone ask the same question before? REPLY: I had asked a similar question quite some time back. They told me that it is mostly completion based (~90%). The same is also mentioned on Coursera... I guess.  REPLY: Thank you! I guess i will just do my best to complete the project. REPLY: Something doesn't sound fair in that way of grading: I could have planned less functionality and completed my project. But I wanted to stretch myself by planning more features and do as much as possible - unfortunately, ran into many setup issues on Windows (since the Educational Web was only tested on Mac &amp; Linux) and will probably be completing only ~ 50% of what I had listed in the project proposal. The amount of effort spent has been more than double of the minimum of 20 hours. So if we go strictly by whether the project was completed, I will be penalized for trying to do more. I'm guessing the evaluation will be more fair and look at the context, details, efforts, etc. in addition to just the % of planned work completed...  Thanks! REPLY: I'm pretty sure 90% is completion. 10% is based on how your peer reviewer grades you. REPLY: I think the phrase "graded based on completion." is the confusing part - it appears for project proposal and progress report too. The Coursera project overview page (<https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview|Course Project Overview | Coursera>) says "Thus, your course project work would be *graded primarily based on your effort*. If you have followed our guidelines and completed all the required tasks, you should receive at least 90% of the total points for the project." All the required tasks here are the tasks outlined such as proposal, progress, documentation, code submission, etc. "Upon completion" implies upon completion of all these tasks. REPLY: I think Michael is right. 90% of the project is “when you done, you automatically got 100% “. So at least you do something, then you got 90% of project. But the rest of it will be depended on how good your project really is. REPLY: The 90% of the project is a fair point, assuming source code, documentation and demo video are provided. For the competition projects, if you beat the baseline you’ll get 10% extra credit. As if you get the project done 100%, as long as you beat the baseline. REPLY: Another word: 90% completion + 10% is for the quality/performance of the project (such as beating the baseline).  
THREAD: It’s said there would be one more extra credit opportunity. Anyone heard of anything? REPLY: Hi <@U011PK87A69>, it has been released already. Piazza post @1323. About Lecture Concept Preview. I am not aware if there is a newer one than this.  REPLY: So first the video subtitle fix then this concept preview. I am not sure if you are referring to another new opportunity after these two? REPLY: If you read the end of concept review, it says there will be one more. REPLY: Yeah I think there is supposed to be one more yet, but it hasn't been announced... maybe post a new thread on piazza? REPLY: I checked the thread it seems gone. Not sure what’s the plan now. Probably people did pretty well on final so they decide to let it go. REPLY: well this post says there will one more extra credit opportunity coming up <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1323> REPLY: How can i invite someone to review for this <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1323>?

THREAD: Re the exam and quizzes....anyone else find all the double negative questions annoying...have to be extra careful with them :grinning: REPLY: SO FRUSTRATING.  I missed a 100% on all of the quizzes because of one.  They aren't as bad on the Exam though. 
THREAD: Anyone working on the ExpertSearch system? I am confused on how we can update the datasets REPLY: Yeah, it's confusing.  All of the scripts to build the inputs are in the `extraction` directory, and then you need to run the the `write_file_names.py` script to build the metadata.   Finally, you need to delete the contents of the directory containing the current index (`/data/FacultyDataset` if memory serves) so the index can be rebuilt. REPLY: Thanks <@U01249Y9STH>! So I am trying to add new faculty members to the dataset. So far my code only add new .txt file to the /data/compiled_bios folder and update data/emails to include new faculty members. I guess then I need to run extraction/extract_names.py, extraction/get_location.py, write_file_names.py then delete /data/FacultyDataset?  I also couldn’t find the script to update data/depts and data/unis. Do we need to update them manually? REPLY: <@UMC66KL9G> - we weren't adding new bios (just expanding on the current ones), so I didn't notice that the extraction scripts for departments and universities were missing.  If I were to guess, I'd say those came from this spreadsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198HqeztqhCHbCbcLeuOmoynnA3Z68cVxixU5vvMuUaM/edit#gid=0> REPLY: And yes, step 1 is to run the extraction scripts on the bio .txt files to update the input files that are fed into `write_file_names.py`. REPLY: I see, ok then I will try it first. Thanks! <@U01249Y9STH> REPLY: Sure thing - good luck! REPLY: It works! I have to change some of the scripts though to fulfill my needs. Thanks <@U01249Y9STH> REPLY: Sure thing - good luck!

THREAD: Any feedback on the final exam? easy/twisted? REPLY: it’s fine around same level as midterm, i found it easier tho REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> thanks REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> did you do well on the midterm? REPLY: Yeah I got a 90 on the midterm and 100 on the final. I mainly studied the provided study guide and the quiz answers. REPLY: Also maybe completely irrelevant but I always take like a 30-50 minute break before exams to just relax and absorb all of the studied info, definitely may not work for everyone but figured I’d say so in case it is something that may help others. REPLY: Oh, lol, I forgot what channel I was in!  I also got a 90 on Exam 1 and 100 on Exam 2.  Agreed that the second test was a little easier than the first test.  I also went on Coursera for Illinois and I enrolled in the Text Mining &amp; Analytics course there, and took the quizzes until I got 100% on all of them.  Those questions carried over well to Exam 2. REPLY: Lol fair but yeah same REPLY: It looks like reviewing practice quizzes is not needed, correct? REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> what does that 30-50 minute break look like? Meditation? Listening to music? Playing video games? Study like a wild banshee? REPLY: Any question needed calculation? REPLY: Yup, similar to the calculations in Exam 1 REPLY: Ezra it's usually to avoid the last one so definitely not that one lol. Usually I just like to listen to relaxing music and close my eyes and just try to not think about what I've studied. I do this because I used to cram really hard up until the last minute and noticed that would give me a lot of test anxiety and make it harder to remember everything I learned. I think of it as an absorption and digestion period where my brain has some time to just prepare.  i can't tell you it has made my grades a lot better but it definitely has made me feel more relaxed and like I understand the material a lot more REPLY: &gt; I also went on Coursera for Illinois and I enrolled in the Text Mining &amp; Analytics course there, and took the quizzes until I got 100% on all of them. <@U01249Y9STH> Cheers, this was really good advice - gave me additional practice with new questions/answers and was good prep for the exam. REPLY: 1 hour 20 questions? REPLY: Yup.  I didn’t need that much time. REPLY: Thanks a lot for the feedback, guys. It was really helpful for my preparation. 
THREAD: Does anyone else's progress report peer review mention reviewing the presentation and source code submissions? Um...the progress report definitely didn't require the video presentation to be completed, so full points in this section?? REPLY: Hi Casey, check out pizza post @1330. This is what TA said:  “Please submit the review so that the authors can view your feedback. You can fill in any random values for the questions not related to the progress report.”  Source and video are not related at the moment for progress report review.  REPLY: Just need to fill out questions 1 + 2 according to TA on piazza 
THREAD: Anyone felt the final project is a bit out of control (we chose to reproduce a paper and found not so many libraries are out there to support us)? Or just me? Also I wonder how generous the final project has been graded in past semesters? REPLY: I'm doing a free topic and it is not out of control, but about 25 hours in I don't feel like I have accomplished that much and I haven't even spent time on setting it up to demo, or pulling my results together.  I did not ever expect to 'finish' as it is pretty open ended, but I did expect to get more meaningful results by now. REPLY: Tbh the grading seems pretty lenient, they made it seem like as long as it appears like you put in the work (20-25 hours per student) you will get at least a 90/100. Even regardless if the code works or not, which seems to be the last 10/100 points. REPLY: I am kinda regretting not choosing a free topic…. REPLY: I do wish the instructions were in one location instead of spread across Coursera, Google Docs, CMT, GitHub repos, etc. I feel like I'm missing something in the final project because part of the instructions were in one place, and the other part are in a second place. In Coursera it didn't mention the progress report required a source code submission, but now I'm doing a peer review and it's asking me to check if they submitted source code to review. Wat?? REPLY: You can just ignore that for the progress report. I agree in general everything spread out on Coursera and Piazza etc is a pain 
THREAD: i wonder how much extra credit could be earned in past few semesters for this course? It seems they are planning to release at least 2%… REPLY: In Piazza, Bhavya said the extra credit of MP2.4 is up to 5%:   ”You can calculate the extra credit yourself using the following formula: max(0, 5-(Rank-1)/10). So, you can get up to 5% extra credit, which means 5% of the final grade. Students with the same NDCG score get the same extra credit.   The grading formula on Coursera doesn't allow the overall sum of scores to exceed 100%. So, the extra credits will not be visible on Coursera. We will manually add them to your final grades.” REPLY: 5 (MP2.4) + 5 (Piazza) + 2 (Misc)  = 12% is the maximum REPLY: 5 + 5 + 2 == 7. Roger that. REPLY: You see, this was all crafted very delicately to create a lesson for my fellow peers.

THREAD: Hello guys, do we need to create another submission on CMT for the Progress report? REPLY: If I'm reading the instructions correctly, you add it to your existing CourseProject fork REPLY: Yeah, we definitely need to push it to our github repository. But, do we need to do anything else in the CMT tool? REPLY: There is nothing in the instructions to indicate anything needs to be done in the CMT tool.  Feel free to ask on Piazza though. REPLY: Thank you Michael, for some reason I thought we had to create a new submission on CMT for each milestone. REPLY: Do we need to submit it on coursera also? REPLY: Yes, it says in the screenshot “Then click the Submit button here.” REPLY: Yup ! Just git push your progress report to Course Project —&gt; Back to Coursera page and click “Submit”. That’s it.

THREAD: For Exam 2, do we need to study the slides that are marked Optional in Weeks 10,11 and 12 videos? REPLY: Optional videos can be safely skipped from exam preparation perspective. Pls use the exam guide as the reference.  REPLY: Is there any calculation in the exam 2? I mean do we need to memorize that long formula or understanding the formula intuition is enough? REPLY: Yes the focus is on core intuition. Any calculation indicated as you “must” know in the exam guide is important. Quiz questions provide definite and helpful hint regarding what to expect.

I was thinking whether I need to read the text book before scheduling. REPLY: I personally studied by going over the lectures and practice quizzes. The doc on piazza with the topics was also useful REPLY: Hi Shyam, is it safe to say we can skip the OPTIONAL video lectures to ace the exam 2? I see some conflicting messages about the OPTIONAL lectures are actually in the weekly quizzes. Not sure if this will be the same case for exam 2? REPLY: The content from the optional lectures wasn't on the exam (I skipped them while studying) 
THREAD: Hi everyone, I submitted my tech review and LiveLab shows score 1, but Coursera status does not change to Submitted. Is that expected? REPLY: I would commit some insignificant change, and push.  I had one time where the hook didn't work properly, and the second attempt did. REPLY: (I'm not sure which assignment it was.  It may not have been the tech review.) REPLY: Try to enter from Coursera submission page to Live lab once more. Should appear then. Also, in case even in this case will not appear - try to submit once more REPLY: Thanks guys, I had never clicked on "Open Tool" in Week 11 - Tech Review page as all information was available in Week 1. Which means the Coursera never marked it as "Started", thus not allowing the change directly to Passed.

E Step:			 topic	w=1,d=1	w=2,d=2	w=3,d=3 0	        0.20	 0.30	0.20 1	          0.10	0.10	0.10  Or would the normalization be expected between topic &amp; document separately? For the E-Step we are considering 3D matrix &amp; I have read the resolution from the professor saying, two of the cube slices needs to be normalized. When I applied the formula as in the reference document, this is what I am getting. But my likelihood is diverging instead of converging. &amp; the doc_topic probability is just random. So I doubt if the E-Step is right.  There are lot of messages in Piazza, but still have no clarity about this. REPLY: Note that I havent passed yet, but first I was normalizing by column (so P(topic0, w1) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.1). I asked a TA yesterday and it seems the TAs have two normalization steps where they first do that normalization then _also_ do a normalization across a topic for all the words at the very end. So p(w1, topic0) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.2). I would like to hear how others did it as well. REPLY: For normalization I was also confused, but I attended one office hours, and figured out that for E-step and M-step in the denominator of the formulas the normalization already present. One sum for E-step, and double sum for M-step both formulas - all that give you normalization. So you have the option either to write this sum in the denominator of your formula, or apply propose normalization function to the upper part of the formula, and receive normalized pi and probabilities REPLY: For E-step I calculated sum as it was 3 dimensions and I was not sure how well the normalization function work, and for M-step I applied the function. REPLY: For each doc and for each word in it, you should do normalization across topics (columns) such that the sum of each column should be 1. Normalization for each row is not required. Hope it helps you.. REPLY: Thanks Marina; I did as per the above formula but I don’t see the likelihood converging. Checking if there are any bugs;  Thanks Vijay that helps; let me try that way  REPLY: Tried both these and it is converging sometimes and diverging sometimes. Did this happen to anyone? I am testing with around ten documents; 50% of my runs are converging and others diverging.  REPLY: did you submit to livedatalab and see any errors there? REPLY: No errors but no score REPLY: Try to check if the normalization really happen. Print out sum( P(z = j) , axis equal to the axis of topics) and see if you will see ones everywhere. For formula on the pi - sum over the axis of documents. For formula p(w|Theta) summarize over the axis of vocabulary. In case if in any case you will not see 1-s everywhere, you need to check if the normalization formula application is correct REPLY: Thanks Marina; I figured it out; the normalization was happening but I had a bug in log likelihood which was  actually hindering the convergence;  
THREAD: Hey Fellow CS410's. The tech review got extended by 1 week. <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1045> Stay safe out there folks. REPLY: Tried it too hard but finally got some response :sweat_smile: 
THREAD: Did anyone else get stuck at log likelihood of -1364.4893899729557 and couldn't get out of it? I seem to get to that point fairly quickly, but get stuck there. REPLY: The value has to be negative but I got biggest  number like -15000  REPLY: What log are you using?  REPLY: This is good, kindly check difference using eplison and that will lead to converge (' Log Likelihood after iteration ', 18, '-1334.1393977467312') REPLY: PLSA can converge to many locals depending on initialization. Global converge is optimize solution. -1334 is better than -15K REPLY: Log likelihood for my 1st iteration was at -17k. And it got converged around 115th iteration in my local. When I submitted the code for grading, it got converged at ~ 25th iteration itself and passed. I don't think the log likelihood value doesn't matter as long as it converges at some nth iteration. That was my understanding. REPLY: I used np.log in my log likelihood function so I think that's correct. I think the issue may be in my e step normalization: I'm normalizing on topic columns as many have suggested but it's not working for me. But it could also be my m-step normalization is off. Anyone have any tips on how to debug? I've been stuck debugging all week but can't make much progress as I'm not sure what to compare against. REPLY: Actually nevermind: I got it to pass just now. My E step and M steps were correct, but I had an issue with word counts per document and accidentally removing the first word from lines 100-1000 because my method to read data from the file was removing that number from lines 1-100 but my try/except was erroneously still removing the first entry from the line for lines 100-1000. 
THREAD: Nvm I found the issue  REPLY: <@U0147TVTF5E> I am getting the same error. What did you do to resolve it? REPLY: Hi I got the error because I was using the test. Text path instead of the variable that they gave us in the code also I got it bc when I was looping I was using the number 2 instead of the variable number_of_topics  REPLY: Ok. I am not doing any of those - I mean I am using number_of_topics and self.documents_path but still getting the error. 
THREAD: How many interaction does MP3 does in liveDataLab for the test.txt? Bc I’m getting this error  REPLY: Had same issue. Start checking one by one M-step and E-step, eliminating the source of the issue REPLY: For one of them there will be an error, bringing whole matrix to same values in each row REPLY: Thanks <@U012LLB5SHJ>  I already find the issue  REPLY: Omar, for me it finished in 25 iterations.... if you scroll up someone got it in 18 iterations REPLY: Don't get too hung up on the number of iterations - remember, we're all starting from random initial weights :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Yeah thanks I solved the issue and passed the MP3  
THREAD: Is our tech review not included in our final grade? REPLY: The tech review doesn't get graded, but it is required. 
THREAD: How long did it take the MP3 run for DLBP? It is running for last 2 hours. Is that how long it took? REPLY: Locally, it wouldn't run in any reasonable amount of time for me. On live data lab, it ran super quickly. REPLY: Live data lab doesn't run DLBP, I don't think.  I'm not sure what data it runs. How many EM iterations did it do in 2 hours? REPLY: Live data lab runs almost exactly the test.txt (I printed out the document from livelab). REPLY: Hi Savitha, I completed MP3 without even touching DLBP at all. I somehow believe grader is only using ‘test.txt’. If our code can achieve the convergence (considering epsilon) within less than (or equal to) 50 iterations, I think it will pass. REPLY: btw, use the first 100 records in ‘test.txt’ to evaluate your code (or numbers such as likelihood) REPLY: My code took whole night for one or two iteration on DLBP.txt and still running. I guess loops are not good. Anyone validated with numpy libraries how efficient they are? I will try to run my algo on powerful linux server Vocabulary size:30140 Number of documents:10835 Number of Topics: 2 EM iteration begins... Initializing... Inside initialize_randomly Iteration #1... E step: M step:  Log Likelihood after iteration   1 -12172240.74027438 REPLY: It really comes down to how many loops you are running.  My E and M steps are the slowest thing, and it's because I still have double nested for-loops.  I managed to do a 1D vector-wise dot product, but not 2D.  If you can even just convert the last loop to a numpy vector dot product (np.dot), that will probably help you a lot. Keep in mind, DLBP is not run by the grader.  You don't have to be efficient for their tiny data set.  You just have to be right.  It's very gratifying to vectorize the code, though, _if you have time_. REPLY: My code sconverged on the test file in 3 iterations. Does that seem possible? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> in my case it took 13 iterations when running locally on the test data REPLY: <@US1DJGCSH> my submission converged after iteration 18 within less than 13 seconds REPLY: I wonder if the grader just runs your estep and mstep one time and sees if you get the right results REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> it runs multiple times, but specifically it sounds like they are comparing the results (index max) of the document_topic_prob matrix based on a piazza question I made REPLY: Which post was that? At this point there is so much activity on MP3 on Piazza it is hard to sort things out there. REPLY: It was a private question here, "the autograder uses a different dataset that the one provided for you to test your code, it runs your plsa algorithm and then looks at how your code classified each document as belonging to which topic (taking the maximum document-topic probability as indicator that the document belongs to/covers that topic the most). If your code converges locally then doesn't succeed with the autograder, check how the code classifies the document in the test.txt file you're given, i.e. look at the converged self.document_topic matrix and see if it classifies the documents correctly.  Also, remember not to hard code anything in your code (use number_topics, not "2" for example), the autograder's dataset is different than the one provided for you." REPLY: thanks interesting 
THREAD: How did people end their `plsa` function? Curious if I am missing a return statement or what, i have no idea wht the autograder is getting triggered on tbh REPLY: I didn't return anything REPLY: I did return it. Both ways will work.  REPLY: oops, final project distracted me a bit. for plsa no need to return anything. sorry. 
THREAD: MP3 - I am not able to understand how epsilon is used in the program; can anyone please guide or point to some reference? REPLY: Slide 10 of PLSA Part 2 says: ```Computation of the EM Algorithm • Initialize all unknown parameters randomly • Repeat until likelihood converges``` What does "converge" mean?   It means when the likelihood of the model doesn't change very much from one iteration to the next.  What does "very much" mean?  You guessed it!  If the change in the model's likelihood is smaller than the epsilon. REPLY: Difference between Likelihood at iteration n and likelihood at iteration (n-1) should be less than epsilon to stop the likelihood calculation loop REPLY: Thank you! REPLY: Interesting. I didn't use the epsilon, but still passed. The grading must be somewhat lenient. REPLY: I don't think the grading cares if you converge or not, but then, I'm not sure what the grader is testing either. REPLY: grading might be using its own epsilon and number of iterations to converge based on the likelihoods generated REPLY: I guess that’s why question says we are free to modify main() as grader has its own way to check the code  
THREAD: What are some initial likelihood values people are seeing at iteration 0 on test.txt REPLY: <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C20U1T84T/p1603487876443800?thread_ts=1603468332.437000&amp;cid=C20U1T84T> REPLY: Sweet thanks, must have been buried in a conversation i didnt read through REPLY: If you scroll through that conversation, others had different (but still very negative) starting likelihoods REPLY: That is roughly what I am at. Still not passing w/ around -1400 in the autograder, looks like i need around -1300 REPLY: Did you keep around the removal of the 0's and 1's from the test.txt when you submitted? Im curious if my funkiness with that is what is causing issues REPLY: I kept the 0s and 1s - basically I split by tab first, and then I split the last element in the first split by space REPLY: You also have to be careful when splitting by space - you might accidentally absorb the newline character as one of the "words" REPLY: Ah okay, ill check it out, i didnt run the DBLP text because it just is too large. I wasnt expecting that to be the issue but i hope it is REPLY: Just print the first couple of lines; it should be obvious if you see `\n` as one of the words in the array. REPLY: Yeah, don't see anything - unfortunately. Means there is a bug somewhere else. Thanks for the help! REPLY: Good luck.  I am sorry that this MP doesn't give you a lot of guidance in the middle; you basically have to write a bunch of code and hope all of it's right. REPLY: Debugging large matrices is hard haha. Finding bugs when this look "close" enough is even harder REPLY: Yeah, I ended up using loops, because it was easier (for me) to translate the formulas into loops. REPLY: Someday I'll be smart enough to see how to convert those equations into matrices REPLY: Someday I will be smart enough to get it work in the first place =P 
THREAD: I finally succeeded to complete the MP3. I was not able to do M-step in matrix multiplications, probably sometimes next time:) Did it with double loop. For E-step I succeeded to do the single loop +matrix multiplication for the rest of dimensions (I'm not sure if we can avoid loops at all here, if somebody did - please tell). The most helpful thing was to write each step on the paper, indicating the dimensions, and the exact formula of each step. I think I never wrote so much during MP before:) REPLY: I feel similarly! I'm almost finished and wasn't able to work productively until I wrote out the formulas on paper in a way that was easy for me to understand. REPLY: if you do the calculation using log.. you don't have to use matrix multiplication and may avoid loop altogther.. this is what EM assignment in AML is doing.. haven't tried it for this assignment... REPLY: I  decided to start with formulas from this course as I started this assignment earlier than AML. Bthw - just found how to eliminate one of the loops in M-step. So I have 1 loop in E step and 1 loop in M-step. 
THREAD: Hi guys any hint on how to calculate the log likelihood for MP3? I think I’m applying the log() in the wrong place, also do we have to return self.likelihoods?  REPLY: The log-likelihood function is discussed on Slide 6 of *`9.8 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA): Part 2` ... I needed to listen to that part of the lecture again to understand the equations I was looking at.* 
THREAD: I am having a little trouble normalizing my 3D matrix in the E-Step. Can anyone provide some pointers? REPLY: Hi, REPLY: Are you able to normalize 3D matrix in E step? REPLY: I used Michaels suggestion below and that worked for me. It will depend on your implementation, but if you are using for loops it should work. 
THREAD: I ran my stuff against DBLP.txt, needless to say, it was stuck on "EM iteration begins..." for like 10 minutes, before I killed the process. I decided to try my luck and submit anyway :laughing: good luck all! REPLY: I think building the term_doc_matrix is taking a while the way I did it REPLY: same here, I got test.txt to pass in the first attempt but I couldn't even run one EM iteration REPLY: luckily my submission also passed in livedata lab 
THREAD: How to decode submission error? I am getting following error during submission, how to resolve this issue? Currently I have tested my code on test.txt, do we need to validate code on DBLP.txt as well? _You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command._ _[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/azure/data/cs410/mp3_test.txt'_ _File "mp3_grader.py", line 81, in &lt;module&gt;_ _test_plsa.post_results()_ _File "mp3_grader.py", line 65, in post_results_ _raise Exception("GRADING FAILED!!!

Please check the logs above for details_ _Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure_ _Finished: FAILURE_ Thanks, Suraj REPLY: I don't believe the grader uses DBLP, but DBLP can bring issues to the surface that you won't see on test.txt, so it is good to test with DBLP too. I had several errors pop up in the grader because I was using Python 3.x instead of 2.7, which the grader uses. That _Permission denied: mp3_test.txt_ looks unfamiliar.  You could try making a small whitespace change and submitting again.  If the mp3_test.txt permissions problem isn't related to any file operations you do in your code, and a second run has the same issue, I'd send a private note on PIazza and see what they say. REPLY: Thanks <@UCC3KEKU7>, problem was resolved after removing following two lines from code #self.vocabulary.remove('0')             #self.vocabulary.remove('1') But now I am getting zero score, how to debug it further?

THREAD: Coursera is telling me I completed the Text Information Systems course.  Is this happening for anyone else? REPLY: I haven't seen that yet, but sometimes that happens with Coursera.  As soon as you have enough points to earn a passing grade, they send you that. REPLY: But now I can't use the Coursera app to play the videos on my TV through Chromecast! REPLY: My coursera looks normal to me REPLY: Why would you want to watch the rest?  You already passed! :laughing: Ok, I don't know about the chromecast.  Whenever this happened to me, I still had access to all the content. REPLY: Great job! :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I have received same message for my AML. Never had it before, seems Coursera made some changes on the portal REPLY: Wow ! Congratulations already :blush: But I guess Exam 2 isn’t open yet and Group Project is peer-graded at the very least. Not sure how Coursera came to the conclusion.  May be finished with all the lectures, quizzes and MPs. That may be the reason. REPLY: I finished all of the MPs, but I've been going one-week-at-a-time, and now I'm on Week 10.  It's so weird! REPLY: 60% course completion seems to be cutoff for AML and this happened to few students and few posts on AML slack. There may be a cutoff set by UIUC TIS course which might have triggered the message. All in all, it’s good :blush: 
THREAD: Sorry folks, I should have made that poll anonymous REPLY: I participated in the poll, found out it is not anonymous, can't undo my poll :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: better do it in an anonymous manner.

THREAD: For the project proposal, do we submit it on Github? REPLY: Yes, follow the instructions posted in Coursera under week 9. You push the document to github and also create a submission on CMT 
THREAD: Now that I revisited 1-6 chapters for Exam 1, I kinda fell in love with this course yet again. I believe I’m getting the big game of text —&gt; web connection and the GREAT game of retrieval and classification.   This course is kind of “Exploitation” (of what I know and tweaking a bit) vs “Exploration” (opportunities for learning more by exploring) compared to my other class AML. Anyone felt the same way?  Don’t get me wrong, Prof. Forsyth is a renowned Computer Scientist and well known and reputed in Computer Vision but somehow AML isn’t cutting for me. I’m not motivated to do the assignments to say the least.  This course on the other hand, I already have ton of ideas in NLP/Text that can be worked out as pet projects / product ideas / papers etc. Anyone working on any interesting text problems right now? It’d be awesome to hear from you. REPLY: Prof. Forsyth’s on-campus video is waaaaaaaaaay better. He explains things crystal clear and he likes handwriting everything down with pen and paper. For some reason, he used slides when recording online lecture… That’s why it’s a bit off to watch him reading slides. And again, I don’t dislike auto-grade assignment. But project is really needed for a course called “Applied xxx”. REPLY: Is there a link or slides for Prof Forsyth's on campus lectures? I would be really interested. REPLY: <https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/> This page contains videos for Trevor Walker's lectures in Spring 2019 and David Forsyth's lectures in Fall 2018. REPLY: I agree that Forsyth's recorded on-campus lectures are quite good.  Trevor's lectures are also good.  He has quite a few on neural nets later in the course REPLY: <@U011PK87A69> - Thanks Devin for the inputs. You are right. I checked the previous online 19,18 lectures and they are good in making us understand the core concepts. Somehow, I am disconnected with “Applied” part of ML in this course. I work in ML/Advanced Analytics group. I don’t see anything that we use in a pure enterprise grade setup. I appreciate the fact that “Applied” in the context of this course relates to building from ground up (like Numpy etc) but unsure if it’s worth the effort. To be very honest, Piazza and Slack is more helpful solving assignments than the textbook/slides. That’s the sad part for me. I guess we have to live with it.

THREAD: In the above example why is the unary portion `1110`  8 and not 4? REPLY: You don't need to know the log values for gamma encoding.  You need to know the _floor_ of log values.  Try a few out and figure out the pattern.  Also, <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=836> REPLY: Something else that may help: if the unary portion is n bits, the remainder will be n-1 bits. In other words, the remainder is the binary representation of the addend to the unary portion represented in n-1 bits. REPLY: So for 10, your unary portion would be 1110, which is equal to 8, so you only need to add 2, which we render in binary with three bits 010, so your gamma code would be 1110010 REPLY: extremely helpful, thank you both! REPLY: cool thanks guys! REPLY: One more thing, for Floor(Log2(x)) formula is  for any x, 2^k&lt;= x&lt;2^k+1 =&gt; so the value of Floor(Log2(x)) will be equal to k .  for eg: 6  2^2&lt;=6 &lt; 2^3 =&gt; so we pick the lower value ( floor) k which is 2.  n = 11  2^3&lt;=11 &lt; 2^4 =&gt; again lower k = 3  and with the link provided by <@UCC3KEKU7> you can verify this. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Yep, you've got it!  The formula on the slide, while technically correct, isn't nearly as nice as having the intuition of what that floor-log2 is doing. REPLY: In the above example why is the unary portion `1110`  8 and not 4? REPLY: IIRC (I took the exam Oct 5th so it’s a little fuzzy now) you count all the 1s up to the first 0, so 111 = 3; 2^3 = 8 REPLY: Where does 2^3 = 8 come from?  In another example `11001`  11 = 2 2^2 = 4 01 in binary = 2 2 + 4 = 6  Why does the lecture say this equals 5?  Am I missing something obvious? REPLY: 01 in binary is 1 in dec. REPLY: OIC. I've been doing it backwards :face_palm: REPLY: 2^(Number of 1s before 0) + (Binary code after 1s) REPLY: so to encode a number we just find the highest power of 2 and add binary to it? REPLY: Thanks everyone!  This was one of the final things I felt I needed to spend some time on before the exam. REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: I watched the video about piazza again and the professor is very clear to say "up to 5%" REPLY: I think in the intro video the professor said they will be counting how many postings each student made, and then determine the score based on the number of postings.

So that will allow you to actually increase your grade as will be shown here in more detail. And this is how we are going to determine your final letter grades. They are based on the grade points you have collected over the semester using this map shown here on the slide. Mostly it's five points for each bracket but not always. And as you can see, if you have earned 5% extra credit and when adding this extra credit, will likely help you move your grades up by one bracket, although it won't be more than one bracket. ``` REPLY: I asked it in the TA zoom after you left :stuck_out_tongue:. I guess they have an advanced formula that includes endorsed posts, overall activity, and the ratio of useful vs spam posts.

THREAD: Anyone else start on MP3 yet? REPLY: Congratulations  REPLY: Thanks!  My likelihood starts at -179413.22719749954 in the first iteration and ends at -158917.11630642737 in the 50th REPLY: Shouldn’t it converge before 50th iteration ? REPLY: Are we suppose to see 1 or 0 on the leaderboard? REPLY: yes, you would see 1 on the leaderboard.. i submitted mine few days back.., i was struggling with matrix multiplication and eventually settled for “for” loop.. now i have submitted, i am thinking to try matrix multiplication now… REPLY: <@UANGTNASY> mine didn’t converge before the 50th iteration, but it did converge in the automated tests run during the submission. REPLY: I was able to converge in less than 10 rounds but still couldn’t pass the test. REPLY: Finally beat the autograder although it’s weird to me... it didn’t converge... My loglikelihood is also far away from yours REPLY: The autograder converged on the 23rd iteration for me REPLY: Finally ... converged at 11th iteration :) REPLY: lol mine starts at -33000 and then just gets more negative... REPLY: are there multiple local maxima? try running with different widely spaced initializations? REPLY: I got it!!! That was a difficult one, but well worth it lol REPLY: This is very confusing, I'm pretty sure i have the right implementations so i'm not even sure where to start debugging :sweat_smile: REPLY: Mine did not converge locally or in the autograder, yet I got 100% :thinking_face: REPLY: so, if we go through Lectures, will we able to figure out the Formulas to be used in Assignment MP3? REPLY: Yes, that’s what I did.  I needed to listen to some of the lectures again in order to understand the likelihood formula, but otherwise, it’s all there. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> Thank you much. I am yet to start MP3. Looks like more coding.. Hope i will be able to finish before deadline REPLY: Hi, I haven't started MP3, how much time is required to complete this assignment after going through week 9 lecture/videos? Any hints for reducing inital bumps/no clue phase? REPLY: Working on likelihood tonight. Hope will be done with MP3 without much issues. Wish to finish this and go on to Tech Review. More excited for Tech Review although not adding any score.   My tech review is about - NLP Evolution - The Past, Present and the Future. Hope will finish and will share it with the class. 
THREAD: Hi Everyone, I need to take a break till Oct 31st. I will resume on Nov 1st again. I looked at all deadline and it feels like I’m not missing any deadlines. I finished my week7 assignment and Exam1. I’m yet to complete MP3. Need your help to ensure that I’m not missing any deadline. Thanks in advance! REPLY: I think the easiest way to check all deadlines is to go to the Grades page on Coursera. REPLY: Yes Joe, I did that. Everything seems fine to me. The next dead line is on Nov 8. But, Is that all? Is everything listed under Grades? REPLY: there is a tech review, which can take you all day, and there is a MP3, which can probably take the same (haven't tried yet, so comments from peers welcomed on timing). For tech review the deadline was last week to submit proposal, and for the project one - this week. At least the project proposal costs some % of total grade, so you won't want to miss it I think. REPLY: if you will submit project proposal this week and you will have entire 3 days to work on tech review, MP3 and quizzez till 4-th of November, you are good REPLY: Group Project Proposal - before Oct 25th. Tech Review -  before Nov 8 MP3 - before Nov 8 (please have some buffer) All quizzes from Week 7-12 - before Nov23  Bottom line - If you take care of “Project Proposal” you are good. Enjoy your off-time. REPLY: Hi Marina, My team and I are planning to submit the project proposal this week. Thanks for pointing out the tech review task. REPLY: Thanks Dheeraj for the dates! They are reassuring! 
THREAD: does proctoru pause/disable you if you look down? I know we are permitted two sheets of paper and I don't know if looking away from the screen to the paper on your desk will  lock you out REPLY: They can speak and stuff, so I guess they might warn you.  I did write on my sheet and looked around a bit (I am sure), and it wasn't any trouble. It should be fine as long as they can see your full face I guess. REPLY: They also have you use your camera to look around your work place before you begin your exam. So they will have some sort of understanding that you didn't tape a piece of paper to a wall or something. REPLY: They made me move my camera a bit so they could see me better, which made seeing my screen a pain in the butt REPLY: I think I'm going to buy a webcam instead of using my laptop camera because it really was difficult to see the screen at that angle. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> oh did they have you angle it downward toward your desk or something? REPLY: Yes, exactly. REPLY: How were they also able to see your face? REPLY: Oh just tested it out REPLY: I guess they need to see your head and the top half of your shoulders REPLY: And they were only able to see my face REPLY: It was only an issue for one test, but that test was pretty brutal without the additional strain of struggling to see my screen REPLY: For my cs519 midterm REPLY: Have asked me to show all the sides again in the middle of the exam. Just depends on the proctor.  REPLY: They asked me in the middle of the exam to readjust my camera, but were nice about it...e.g. keptapologizing.

THREAD: For MP3, the converged doc topic matrix, do we need to care about exact zero/one to be seattle/chicago ? Since I'm getting inverted result of zero one as compared to test file. REPLY: 0 is seattle and 1 is Chicago. You need to match your results with the doc to verify that what your are doing is correct REPLY: Let's say the 2 J topic columns are J0 and J1, so what you mean is J0 is seattle and J1 is Chicago. Then while J0 closes to 1 and J1 closes to 0, it is indicating the predication is Seattle ? REPLY: Did you figure out this issue? REPLY: Yes and it doesn't matter, as long as the one column is close to 1 while the other is close to zero.

"It reads sentences, takes the text and creates a mathematical representation of that text, such that sentences that have the same meaning map to the same thought," she said.

THREAD: I’ve immense admiration and respect for “Reckoner” #1 in the leaderboard and the numbers on each dataset are the top notch in the entire leaderboard.  Either he/she deeply understood the “Data” and how “BM25” works internally to the core and be able to tune or augment data/clean the data and feed the clean or “rich” data to BM25. I really wish this is the case and not just gaming the system having different set of params over fitting to each dataset.   Kudos to EVERYONE in Top50. Moving onto next chapter - “Text Classification”. See you there.   Oh by way, watch out for “Sarcasm Experts” on the Leaderboard. REPLY: I am reckoner :smile:, I can't promise you that I did not overfit But I was able to achieve #1(0.711, it would have been #2 now) by only changing the formula. I spent around 9 submissions more to tweak the parameters. REPLY: <@U018EJ65U5V> now that it is over. I'm assuming you made slight modifications to BM25? REPLY: Tho for the record, I think so it is still fair and exciting if people brute forced and reached near the top, and if it were a normal job, I wouldn't mind a highly tuned ranker for my particular dataset.  I  was able to try the entire family of functions, BM25, BM25L, BM25Plus and if people hadn't found out competitive baselines, it wouldn't have been fun trying newer models. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> Yes, the winning function was a modified BM25Plus, but I changed the query param (removed k3 param as it was useless (I think so from your own results you would be able to see that high values of k3 were useful, and if you look at the query normalization function, high k3 means, k3 was getting canceled out. REPLY: BM25plus taking from here: <http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/andrew/papers/2014-2.pdf> Our professor made it!! REPLY: <@U018EJ65U5V> I did the same as yours; ignored k3 first and then QTF overall ; it didnt matter; and added delta to IDF portion; but didn’t fine tune k1 &amp; b post that; curious to know what your k1 &amp; b are? Did you change anything else on the BM25 function? REPLY: I did use QTF, only removed k3 from that. I also used an if condition for ctd (if it is &lt;0, score = 0). Finally I used rocchio feedback on 80:20 split to get params. BM25Plus params I adjusted by hand, but the default params also got me the second spot. 
THREAD: For today's deadline all we needed to do was put an entry on the google sheet, right? REPLY: wait which deadline REPLY: tech_review REPLY: Tech Review. Yep. Can anyone confirm that is all that needs to be done REPLY: Yes, I would agree with you <@UMCB313QT>, it looks quite clear here <https://github.com/Bhaavya/tech_review> REPLY: Wow thanks for the reminder!

The same is updated in Coursera as well. 
THREAD: This is me right now REPLY: I am curious, did you make a script or were these manual submissions? REPLY: script REPLY: it would create a submission, and then check to see if the results have been updated. Log the results, next item. REPLY: nice REPLY: what's the logic for parameter updates? REPLY: I did a mixture of things. I created a function that does all of the above that would just be fed a ranking function + values. Then I utilized excel to look into trends and populate a long list of items that I wanted to get checked over a certain amount of time. If I was given more time on this assignment. I would have implemented a machine learning aspect. I could have also did like 20k submissions, but I didn't want to over do it. REPLY: I can do 1 submission in aprox 20-30 seconds. REPLY: I will say that there are a few trends that I saw that I was almost positive would result in a higher overall score, but then it would get to an x value and instead of a high number, the return looked almost random. 
THREAD: Any inputs about Exam 1? I have scheduled my exam for tomorrow. I went through lecture videos, quizzes and study material. Is that enough? REPLY: I think the exam 1 is tricky. There are a lot of high-level stuffs, which actually make the exam a bit trickier than i thought. It would’ve been a lot straightforward to do calculation IMO. But overall it’s not hard. REPLY: Agreed it’s not hard, but I wish I went into it with a better understanding of the Okapi/BM25 algorithm.  I earned 90% but I’m mad at myself for not doing better. REPLY: Thank you much..   <@U011PK87A69> When you say high-level stuffs, does that mean it had many theoretical questions? REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> 90% is good. Great. Hope i get decent score tomorrow REPLY: I am afraid i cannot tell you what exactly it looks like. But you have to understand each formula, why is it put together in this way? REPLY: Let's keep this fair by not giving any details about the exam until everybody's taken it. REPLY: I can say this without breaking any rule I guess: follow what is emphasized (must know &amp; able to calculate) in the readily published exam guide and you will do just fine.

THREAD: I'm coming for you guys :joy: REPLY: Have you automated your submissions? :smiley::joy: REPLY: Your overall score was already at 0.710 when you made the 1055th submission. It was the highest I've seen in the board. The current highest is 0.709 that's still below your score. I'm puzzled why you are still making the submissions. Are you trying to crash the server?:grin: REPLY: Poker Face REPLY: Gotta catch them all REPLY: There is better numbers out there and I'm going to find them :laughing: REPLY: Get that .8 in there!! Go! Go! Go! :grinning: REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> after the final, will you please share your thought process or you method of how you achieved the top? I tried different ways of optimization and I can get my local ndcg@cranfield up to 0.366, but I am still failing. REPLY: I really would like to learn how can I improve my search method. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> - Poof ! There it goes. Magic. Don’t see your 4 figure submissions anymore :upside_down_face: Wish you good luck ! REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> overfitting can be harmful. You can do a test/train as mentioned on piazza. I would probably say the people in top 10 that don't have 2000 submissions probably have better advice. :joy: My approach was mainly brute force. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> I see you hiding at the bottom of the leaderboard.  You already have the best score possible, and you're just lulling everyone into a false sense of security until 11:55 PM tomorrow, right? REPLY: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: pushpit has a pretty good score. The competition is definitely going to be close. Truthfully, in the middle of testing numbers I stopped to focus on studying and I did not get around to putting my best numbers up yet. I'm pretty sure the numbers are going to change dramatically tomorrow. I would not be surprised if a bunch of people that are on the bottom shoot to the top. REPLY: Just to be honest the last 1200 submissions I did were a waste, and it not gain me anything. There is a few numbers on the board that I just can't beat. REPLY: I'd be happy with top 10. REPLY: Well, I'm #9 now, so that'll be my rank once you fix your score :laughing: REPLY: Maybe I'll have the same score as someone in the top leaderboard and then move everyone up by 1 :slightly_smiling_face: Seems risky though lol REPLY: ended up on 28th, I whish I could have dedicated more time to this. It was super fun to compete though. 
THREAD: How did everyone pass MP2.4? I tried all the methods. I can tune my BM25 on cranfield.dat above 0.365 (same as 1st ranker on leaderboard) and I submitted more than 150 times and my score is still zero. I wonder what else I can do. REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> - Yes, you are right. We can’t say it’s generalized to other two datasets (AP and Faculty) unless we submit. What Ray meant was you shouldn’t strive for 90% accuracy on Cranfield as it will not perform well(generalize) on “Unseen Data” (AP and Faculty). This activity is more of checking what combination of k1, b and k3 can perform better on all three datasets. REPLY: The max on Cranfield I saw was around 36% which also performed well on other two and beat the baseline. REPLY: Usually k1 and b are kind of standard given several prior experiments and works well in the range k1 between 1-2, b between 0 and 1 and k3 depending on the smoothing you want on Query length. I used k3&lt;5 to beat the baseline. Hope this helps.  <https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch|https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch> REPLY: @<https://app.slack.com/team/U01BDCQ3EMT|Dheeraj (you can call me D)> thanks . I will try that REPLY: <@UEZT8D0SU> <@U019BTMTVLJ> - Please do DM me if you still have any questions. REPLY: I would take the scores on the leaderboard with a grain of salt. It seems clear to me that many people are building their models for each dataset and are switching the model based on the dataset to get higher scores, which is pretty hilarious. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> how would one do that? just curious because you just submit the ranker to the grader REPLY: The load_ranker method takes the config file as an argument. It's just a matter of reading the config file and checking which dataset is being used to choose which ranker you load. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> - But, that’s gaming the system. Isn’t it? It’s not the intent of this exercise I suppose. REPLY: Yeah, exactly. That's why it's so funny to me. Each of the rankers used will be overfitting each dataset, which is exactly the opposite of the intended lesson. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: REPLY: :smile: Agreed :smile: REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN>, how you came to the conclusion that different methods are being used for different data set? Its quite possible that many of top scorers are trying new alogs for better scores :grinning: REPLY: Somehow I am not able to up score for Faculty whatever I do can reach max to *"*0.9239370430896358". Any suggestions apart from using different model for diffferent data set? REPLY: I guess that is technically possible. Fair point. I hope they will share the new ranking functions after the assignment deadline if that is the case.   As for your second question, I found the default bm25 k1 and b parameters were very close to the best I could find without overfitting. k3 definitely should be tweaked since the default value is way too high. Try making slight changes to b and k1 after you've found a good k3, and I mean very slight. That was the best I could do. REPLY: There's probably a better way to test fit than I could manage. I couldn't figure out how to get metapy to properly use my train and test data for some reason, and I don't have time anymore to figure out why. If you can manage that you may have better results.  Dheeraj was the one who helped me realize how much of a difference k3 makes. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thanks a lot. You are so knowledgeable and helpful. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> Thanks very much for your suggestions. But I am confused how can we tune k1,b,k3 for faculty data since that we don't have the faculty data set. Do we submit one, write down the score from livedatalab, then try another one? It is hard to web scraping livedatalab, because it is javascript dynamically loaded content. REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> - You are most Welcome Jie. Just doing my bit.  To your other Q, we can’t tune for Faculty as this dataset is unseen data. The idea is to find the parameters which work well with “seen” data (on Cranfield) and check how the parameters are doing on “unseen” data (AP and Faculty). We need to find the “best fit” for all three and not just Cranfield which means if we fit Cranfield exceptionally, if may still fail AP and Faculty as they are different corpuses.  REPLY: If you're wondering how other people are optimizing for the faculty dataset, which I have a very strong suspicion they are, I think they're just tuning parameters and checking the results after each submission. Then they load a ranker with those parameters if the dataset specified in the config file is the faculty dataset. I'm not recommending that you do this, but it is a strategy that works even if it results in rankers that are overfitting their datasets, which is not something you want in a real-world application. REPLY: It seems the default BM25 parameter is the baseline to beat in order to get a full score. It is very unlikely that the default parameter is already the optimal given our data set. It must be the case that there's a direction to which you move a small enough step from the default parameters and get better result. A few times of trial will bring you there I guess

REPLY: Where to find the book - <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=37> REPLY: <@UF4MYF58Q> - Well, that book was written by Professor Cheng Zhai himself, so I guess its taken and granted that the material will be inspired from that book.  <@UMCB313QT> - 3 key resources I’m reading - Text book, Lecture Topics (Videos) and All Quizzes/Additional Material. Mine’s on 20th. Will keep you all posted on the experience and any inputs that I can provide. REPLY: I'm in 4 classes this semester. I actually love to listen to CS 410 Lectures. I would say that I really like how Dr. Zhai delivers it. I know that sometimes it is hard to focus on lectures when the professor might have an accent, but Dr. Zhai is very good. His slight accent doesn't interfere. I enjoy listening to the lectures. Other professors I liked listening to were Dr. Renear for Data Curation and Dr. Dalpiaz.

THREAD: Guys I’m confused with the 2.4 the only thing we have to do is return metapy.index.OkapiiBM25(k1, k2, k3) with the right k values? Do we have to add something in the config.toml or not?  REPLY: I didn't change config.toml.  I'm certain you can pass the HW without touching it. REPLY: Ok so we just need to return the right K values depending of the dataset?  REPLY: Yes REPLY: Yep! REPLY: <@U0147TVTF5E> - That’s right Omar. No changes needed in config file to beat the baseline. Just change the load_ranker() function and add k1, b and k3 to the BM25()  It’s mostly guessing the best optimal parameters. You don’t need for loop as well as checking on other files. The grader will check your parameters against AP News and Faculty. You just need to train or evaluate on Cranfield data. All are set in the program, just play with the BM25 parameters REPLY: so nobody invented a new ranking algorithm as the MP suggested? :P REPLY: I may be close :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: 
THREAD: <@U01249Y9STH> - Interesting. Are you referring to cranfield queries themselves? Or the config? I believe none of the changes to config are considered while grading. It’s default to whatever they have given in first place. Is it essential to tweak with cranfield data itself to arrive at better scores? REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> - sorry for the confusion.  The function signature to implement is: ```def load_ranker(cfg_file):``` I meant that I made use of `cfg_file` when constructing the ranker. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Thank you for the personal message Michael. Appreciate it. Sure, I will think in that direction. For me, Its really become more of digging deeper and learning ALL about BM25 than leaderboard.  Appreciate all your inputs in CS410 class and always helping other students. Bravo :raised_hands::skin-tone-2:  REPLY: I do what I can :slightly_smiling_face:  Good luck! REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Micheal, if I may ask - have you tweaked the config.toml by any means? I heard students “training” on other datasets (AP and Faculty) but how’s this possible? We don’t have access to other datasets, isn’t it?  I changed Analyzers, Filters in config.toml based on MetaPy documentation but didn’t help much. In fact, it didn’t change anything. 
THREAD: Anyone here who got into Top10 of Leaderboard in MP2.4? Any pointers or specific hints to improve the model? Is there a need for custom implementations and latest frameworks or tuning k1, b and k3 suffices? Just curious to know. REPLY: I believe they call it Heuristics. I tried a few of the other frameworks and even the custom we implemented in the earlier MP. Tweaking the k1 and b got me high enough on the board to safely pass with 8 attempts (well, 8 pushes to github, since their datasets differ from the local one on results) and calling it good. 
THREAD: Hi guys, I have found a database of customer support interactions (from cust to company and back).  There are like 9 different companies there. Can you please suggest some ideas on what kinds of analysis I could do with it? I think it brings itself to sentiment analysis. But beyond that any suggestions? REPLY: Some of the usecases I could think of- • Effectiveness of support. • Fraud detection- If support representative charges proportional time (e.g. call centers ) of interactions. • Identify product enhancements opportunities from customer point of view.. • Identify opportunities to enhance support tools  or training customer support. • Sentiment analysis. • Wiki of problems search… you can leverage most this course techniques. REPLY: Predict likelihood of customer renewing their contract / subscription with the company.

THREAD: Hi, for MP 2.4 how do we arrive at the correct values? is it by trial method. I have been trying with the metapy.index.DirichletPrior(mu) and have made 18 submissions so far. The values are close to the baseline but the score is still 0. What method should I follow to tune the parameters? Will any ranker work for this or we need to use a specific one or write our own ranker. Any inputs? REPLY: I'm not sure if it's possible to link other messages but there's a good discussion about this above, on October 2nd. REPLY: When I was manually tuning, I was keeping a record of my numbers of every submission for all three datasets.. that was giving me an idea of which parameter to increase and which one to decrease..I ended up beating the baseline after 28th  trial. REPLY: I used BM25 . REPLY: Thanks <@UMJ1A4SSG> and <@U018ALZD5BN>. Let me try with BM25. So far I had been trying with DirichletPrior with no luck so far. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> is this the conversation you're referring to? <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C20U1T84T/p1601639176043800> REPLY: Yeah that's the one REPLY: Cool, if you hover over another conversation and click on the "More Actions" menu (three dots arranged like a vertical traffic light), there's a "Copy Link" option which will get you a link like the one I pasted above. REPLY: Awesome! Thanks for telling me how to do that haha REPLY: Sure thing! REPLY: BM25 rules :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I was able to solve it with BM25 in 2 attempts. I was just wasting my time with DirichletPrior :neutral_face: REPLY: <@U013A4LTPGF> - Use BM25 - that’s the most powerful of the bunch. That’s the way to beat the baseline. REPLY: I tried with all five algorithms they provided and I could only beat the baseline with BM25.  I'm starting to think the others were offered because there's some value in combining algorithms, but I haven't figured out how to yet. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Yeah, true. I tried all given rankers and a custom built PL2 Ranker and still couldn’t beat BM25. It’s kind of addicting though. Going through research papers now to improve BM25 (not just parameters) but introducing additional coefficients or probabilities into the loop. Will keep this thread updated with further progress.   If anyone still trying to beat the baseline, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. REPLY: The best I could get to was Rank#33 in Leaderboard. Let’s see :crossed_fingers::skin-tone-2: REPLY: Calling it a day, could get to Rank#24. Will try BM25+ paper tomorrow. If anyone interested, I will post the details of the paper and my custom implementation. REPLY: Yes, I'm interested <@U01BDCQ3EMT>! Is the paper linked in the course? REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> - No, paper isn’t linked in the course. There are flavors of BM25 created with optimizations by different organizations and academic contributors. BM25+, BM25F etc. This one from Microsoft Research group.  REPLY: Ah cool I'll start digging REPLY: I’ll keep you posted on further progress and if there is any considerable improvement over my current scores. 
THREAD: Just curious: how many of you are going to do the project by yourself? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - I did a fun experiment to pick up my project team and well, I didn’t get any response from my selections. I haven’t formed my team yet and got few messages from co-students. I may end up doing alone. How about you?  REPLY: Here is what i did as a fun project/experiment REPLY: I haven't tried to either join an existing team or create one myself. It seems so random to just pick someone you don't know. Not like we were actually together on a campus and could get to know each other. In the summer I got lucky and had a partner who worked out very well (A+ in the course and felt the work was split pretty evenly). I haven't thought about what the project I would like to do is, and probably won't give it much thought until after Exam 1, but concerned I will discover that all the "good" partners are gone. :grinning: On the other hand, I'm only taking this one course and am not really too pressed for time, so extra work doing it alone should not be a problem. In some ways I wish the project was assigned rather than picking your own...I think that would make things clearer. REPLY: I will be doing it alone! REPLY: <@U01243RGW0J> - All the very BEST Dixon :+1::skin-tone-2: REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - Wow ! Congratulations for A+ on your other course. Yeah, so true. It’s bit hard to have everyone aligned and not knowing how much one can contribute is a hard challenge. I’ve got few students approach me after posting the fun experiment but now not sure how to go about it. I’ve worked on SOTA Models like NLP Transformers, BERT etc. and wanted to expand on that for final project. However, I am not very sure of others interests. Hard to gauge.  CS410 and CS498 are the first courses I got enrolled starting this Fall. Let’s see ! Hope we all be able to do our best in the final project. REPLY: I joined a team of 5 in my other course, IoT, and so far most of the team is dead weight. Not a lot of initiative, poor communication, and inconsistent check in. They are undergrads and I am an industry veteran, so maybe that is a factor. However, in summer semester, my teammates were also working pros and looking to do the bare minimum, finish up early, etc. Honestly, I feel the overhead of forming teams and working out these kinks of incompatibility do not add much to the learning process, other than how painful &amp; inefficient self-organizing teams can be remotely. REPLY: Ryan, that's my fear. Cynically, I think the reason teams are used in so many of these courses is not to aid learning, but to minimize the amount of grading that needs to be done. :grinning: REPLY: :grin: 
THREAD: Hi Everyone, CS410 is my first course with UIUC. As you are aware ProctorU Exam1 is approaching. Does anyone have suggestions on how to prepare for the exam and pick a date after preparation? REPLY: I'm posting some of my findings here. Hope this helps!  Topics to perapre discussed on this piazza thread <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=540>  Exam format and schedule is discussed here <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=207> REPLY: I'm just going to go through all of the lectures and then the quizzes REPLY: Since this course is action-packed, and the midterm exam opens up the same week we start the second half of the course, I scheduled my exam for tomorrow night. REPLY: I'm going through all of the lectures, the practice exams, and the study guide REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, I scheduled mine next week. Please let me know going though the lecture helped you or not after your exam. REPLY: <@U018NUVUR5F> <@U01249Y9STH> - I’m giving myself time to prepare fully up till now and then give the exam. I’ve scheduled for 10/20. I believe the Exam Topics should be best place to start. I won’t be surprised to see similar or exact questions that we did in Quizzes.  <@U01249Y9STH> - All the very BEST Michael. Do keep us posted on any inputs and direction. Wish you hit 100% REPLY: Thank you!  My exam is 1 hr 15 mins away; I'll report back when it's over.  There's so much content!  I hope I've absorbed enough of it all ... REPLY: All the best!!  REPLY: 90%.  The exam was way scarier in my head than it was on paper.  That said, I definitely didn’t know BM25/Okapi as well as I needed to. REPLY: Going through the old lectures, retaking the practice quizzes, and memorizing some of the formulas definitely did help.  However, I wouldn’t say the study guide is 100% accurate, because there were many examples of “make sure you know X” where X didn’t make it into the exam. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - :clap::skin-tone-2: Congratulations. Thank you so much for the update and appreciate your inputs Michael. I will keep these points in mind.  REPLY: Thank you, and good luck! REPLY: congratulations Mike <@U01249Y9STH>.. Thank you for sharing your experience :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> Congrats! Does the exam had theoretical questions more?   REPLY: A bit of both.  I ended up using the scratch paper for one of the questions. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, congratulations! Thanks for sharing your opinion! It is definitely useful for preparation. 
THREAD: The one thing I learnt from my other class CS498 is how important is to have support from co-students. I am volunteering for any questions on the material, topics, assignments and anything related to CS410 course. I’ve finished upto Week 8 and MP3 and prepping up for Group Project.  Do mention <@U01BDCQ3EMT> me and ask me any question on CS410. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thank you much. I am really finding it hard to tune the parameters in MP 2.3.   I tried around 50 times but then my overall score is always less. Any pointers would help me REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Are you finetuning InL2 or BM25? REPLY: I am using BM25  REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - If you are comfortable with Python, I’d recommend grid search or recursive looping on parameters (k1, k2) and plot the scores to see where it is plateaued. Then find the best possible parameters from that bunch before it starts degrading.  REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Manual/Bruteforce method will take time as you mentioned you tried around 50 times. Approach it programmatically and most importantly recursively. REPLY: I have been using loop to increment values K1 and b but didn’t change k2. Kept k2 as 500. You mean matplotlib to plot graphs?  REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> awesome, thank you for volunteering to do this!  I have a question related to smoothing probabilistic models. In the below, it’s very intuitive for me to understand why this is the correct answer. However, there is an exercise later on where we take that example but use smoothing. In that example, it says that the correct answer uses the exact same value for P(Q|D1) even though we are now smoothing. How can this be? REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Sure, you can use matplotlib or seaborn or bokeh or plotly. Honestly, it’s over engineering and not necessary for this assignment. Reduce K2 and b between 2.75-5. IMHO, try crossing the baseline and then you can work for extra credit. You can change config file to include more pre-defined libraries in TensorFlow or Python to fine tune the same later. REPLY: <@U017V4T5TC7> - If I am understanding your Question correctly, why there is no effect of Smoothing on that example?  Smoothing of P(w1|D1) or P(Q|D1) will remain the same when the term frequency of w1 equals the P(w1,C) in the collection.   Can you point me to the exact example in the slide/quiz? REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thank you for the response. That was where I was getting tripped up… once I worked through the equation more, I saw that it scales relative to the P(w1,C).  Also, I believe I should have been plugging the bottom equation into the normal P(w1,D)*P(w2,D)…. format instead of trying to use the upper equation. Do you know what the upper equation is for? REPLY: <@U017V4T5TC7> - The equation in the above pic is one of the various smoothing methods - essentially this smoothing method is to get the probability of seen versus unseen words in the document using collection language model.  This equation is specific to “Jelink-Mercer” method of smoothing (see below of function f indicating JM). This is a method with fixed coefficient which is lambda. Remember the assignments where we were asked to pick any ranking/scoring functions like BM25, JM etc.  In that example in lesson 4.6 - if we go by “Document” - the term “Network” will have 0 probability as this is not present in the document. Instead of Document, this smoothing takes into account “Collection Model” which will have a non-zero probability for unseen words like “Network” also.   Hope this answers your question. Let me know if you still have any questions. REPLY: If anyone still trying to beat the baseline for MP2.4, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. 
THREAD: Hello All :wave::skin-tone-2:  Hope you are having a fantastic weekend and busy with all "MP Assignments".  I am done with my assignments and prepping for Group Project.  I've deep interest towards State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models in NLP especially - Transformers, BERT (and all flavors) and GPT-3.  I'm planning to work on one of these areas as my project for CS410 - It would be EPIC and AWESOME !!  Let me know if you are one of the selected team members and willing to work with me as a team.  REPLY: Hi Dheeraj, I would like to join. REPLY: <@UAN3XUSCR> - If I may ask, do you have any prior experience working with any of the above topics? Transformers, SOTA NLP models like BERT, GPT-3? 
THREAD: Hi everyone,  For MP2.4, do we need to tune parameters randomly or do we have any other approach? Any inputs are appreciated  REPLY: I think manually tuning the parameters is the way to do it REPLY: That's what I did and passed on the first try...every attempt to tune after that so far has made it worse. :grinning: REPLY: How was MP2.4 compared to the rest of MP2?  Hardest part so far, or about the same? REPLY: So is it basically just luck and manual tuning? I optimized for cranfield but it’s no where close to passing because Faculty is weighted so high.  REPLY: As we cannot access test dataset, i tam thinking we can only guess test dataset (espeically Faculty dataset) feature REPLY: Thank you all.  <@URM1CGMR9>  I tried so far 56 times but I couldn’t clear. I am not sure. What’s the best ranking function for this exercise?   I used JM and tried most of the values for lambda between 0 and 1 but still I couldn’t get a score greater than overall baseline score  REPLY: I am in the same boat.  I have found the best BM25 combination optimized for cranfield but it’s still below the overall baseline.  How do we simulate the Faculty data set without the Faculty queries or relevance? Some people passed on the first try so we must be missing something.  REPLY: tried a grid search over the params on the cranfield data set and it didn't produce a passing result.  Opted for manual grid search through submissions and that did it.  Not sure what we are supposed to be learning through that approach though... Did use some intuition from the grid search to determine which params to fix and which to tune REPLY: <@UJ4UDD4Q7>  yes! I am clueless as what to do  REPLY: I followed Karlin’s method above and finally passed.  Thanks  REPLY: This is the worst assignment of all times... No learning just frustration ...The tuning would be easy if they would have provided us all the datasets.. REPLY: You bet <@UMJ1A4SSG>... it's more a test of patience than anything else! Sigh. I have been trying the approach you mentioned in the other thread and have crossed 28 tries so far, without being much closer when I started. Will probably save this for another day and use my time elsewhere... REPLY: <@UF21ZG5U6>, when you say "manual grid search through submissions", was that over the 'Leaderboard' page looking at the scores  for different data sets and what generated a passing '1'? REPLY: If anyone still trying to beat the baseline, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. REPLY: <@UMJ1A4SSG> - Well, if all datasets were provided, then all of us would’ve overfitted for the data. In real-world implementations the ultimate success or evaluation of any ML model is based on how it performs on “Unseen Data”. Agree that it’s painful to keep submitting and only knowing the score after submission. That’s where the catch is. If we truly understand how these parameters are fitting to “cranfield” data - it’s easy to extend the same to any unseen data.   Just my 2 cents. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Agreed!! But not everyone is familiar with ML model performance tuning...For some people this may be the very first course where they are dealing with ML... I think is they should have given us some methods/ideas/suggestions along with this assignment to play with at least... Or  showed us a practical via lecture video for any other ranker function not used in assignment to at least understand and relate with.... I mean for me personally, I did not build my custom ranker and was just using hit and trial method to beat the baseline...I would like to go back to it sometime and do it again just for my understanding.... REPLY: <@UMJ1A4SSG> - I am with you on “trial and error”. I do agree a reference would have been helpful. I guess its comes to down to patience to arrive at optimum value based on best guesses and multiple submissions. I myself did around 80 to get into Top20 and still trying to improve. I’m unsure if the intent of this activity is for us to “find our way” and read/research about IR rankers and methods etc.

THREAD: For those who already finished MP2.2 , how time consuming is it? I m not expert in Pythong but trying to allocate some time over the weekend to finish...btw, do we need to finish week4 lectures to understand MP2.2? REPLY: I’m glad to know I’m not the only person typing “Pythong” all the time! :laughing: I think it took me the 3 hours that the project allocated for, but look at <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C20U1T84T/p1600815031034400> for some time savers REPLY: <@UME6PDD96> - Let me how you are doing with your assignment. I’m done with MP2.2 and can provide any pointers if you are stuck. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Appreciate your detailed notes and hope it helps anyone attempting MP2.2. I’ve removed arg(sys) and accessed “config.toml” directly to make the program work and successfully generated InL2 average precisions. My Python version - 3.6.6 on Windows REPLY: I think for every single assignment so far, I've spent more time setting up / de-bugging the environment than the actual homework... REPLY: I would complain, but these MPs are a cakewalk compared to the Scientific Visualization ones 
THREAD: What’s a reasonable MAP for MP2.2 when implementing InL2? I saw something on Piazza where somebody said something like .16 is too low but mine is only like .24. REPLY: Mine is .2422. Also what are folks getting for a p-value? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> i just got p = 0.03487 REPLY: I ended up with 0.0001619 REPLY: I got <tel:00000012153|0.0000012153> REPLY: nice REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - For InL2 MAP can be upto 0.30. I have a p-value of 5.813e-06 which is equivalent of 0.000005813 REPLY: That's really impressive... REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - Thank you Howard. I was experimenting with parameters (some_param and top_k) and did a kind of bruteforce on different parameters. I got pretty good results with top_k upto 100 and some_param upto 2.75 and then it degraded. However, the assignment goes through only if we have some_param = 1 and p-value &lt; 0.5.

THREAD: I think all-in-all it took me about 3 hours?  It's a relatively simple project but there are some hiccups to watch out for: 1. The code doesn't work on Python 3.7.  I was able to get it to work on Python 2.8, and others said they were successful on 3.5.  Details on <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=392> 2. The formulas in the README.md don't carry over when you clone the project.  You can look at the original README.md for reference, or view them in Piazza ( <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=429> ), or fix your README.md to add them ( <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=423_f1> ) 3. Not all of the aspects of the formula are clear; this post should help, if you need it: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=368>, and also this one: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=467> 4. For the final part, the README.md says to output results to two different text files and either (a) read them and process a calculation in R, or (b) read them in a new Python program and run the same calculation.  I ended up just running that calculation in the original search_eval.py, and documented how I did it here: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=424_f2> REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, thanks a bunch for your considerate post, sharing your experience and consolidating the relevant links. This is going to be huge time-saver... more than an hour for me for sure. Appreciate that very much! REPLY: <@U018DNRNV1C> - you're very welcome, and good luck! REPLY: Michael, thanks a lot for the summary, I have a question about the formula, in case if yours passed all the tests: in the beginning of 1-st formula there is a sum of counts (term, query). Am I correct that in the function instead of that all what we have is just one count(term, query), and rest of the formula is unchanged? I'm asking, as I have got in the grader the result FEEDBACK: InL2 not implemented correctly!!! FEEDBACK: significance.txt not found or does not contain a valid float value!!!, so I'm trying to understand whether I really inserted formula incorrectly, or there can be some other root cause. And 2-nd question: is your answer on significance looks like X.XXXe-07? This is the format which my R outputs, so I wonder if this can also generate the issue. REPLY: <@U012LLB5SHJ> - that's a good question!  The `score_one` method literally means that it will calculate the score for ONE term, which means the ranker itself will walk over every term in the query + document union and call the `score_one` function, then sum all of the results for you.  Your focus is just to implement the red part, and the framework will handle the rest: REPLY: The significance.txt for me is a number that is formatted in the way that you described, but there is literally nothing else in the file, not even a new line. REPLY: Yes, I did same, but still it report failure. Did you use default parameters or chosen the optimal ones for bm25 as some Piazza post suggesting? Probably, I will try to check with TA on tomorrow office hours, what is the issue, as I think that it is somewhere in parameters probably. I tried to set some parameters to have MAP less than 0.227 on bm25 and left c=1 on my function, but it still did not help. For me it is not clear from the task definition, which parameters to chose for comparison REPLY: hi <@U01249Y9STH> or anyone else, since we're kind of jumping around python versions, what tools/software are you using to readily switch and to run it? anaconda? REPLY: For point number 1. I run the MP2.2 using Python 3.7 on Windows without any issue. REPLY: I found the issue in my function: log function was wrong(did math.log(x) instead of math.log(x,2), just picked up the function description from the wrong source initially, realized just today, with this post. <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=500>. Still, my X.XXXe-07 value is not accepted. Not sure if this is the issue of the format, or some parameters of the rankers need to be tuned. REPLY: <@U0181TGSQH0> - I’m using a Mac and I use brew for most things, and a lot of these dependencies are just magic to me.  On my machine, `python` is Python 2.7, `python3` is Python 3.7, `pip` is for Python 3.x, and `pip2.7` is for Python 2.7.  It’s a mess; hopefully we’ll get away from metapy soon and on towards libraries that are supported by the latest &amp; greatest! REPLY: <@U012LLB5SHJ> - sorry for not responding sooner; I’m not on Slack much.  I’m glad you figured it out! 
THREAD: I know there's a 50% late penalty for the MPs, but is there a similar penalty for the weekly quizzes? REPLY: I believe the first 6 quizzes are due half way through and last 6 at the end. REPLY: I think the deadline that we see on assignments or quiz are the soft deadlines which would not cause any penalty? The actual deadlines are the one which are on the week 1 Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar page? Please correct me if I'm wrong?

THREAD: I mean the names of the staff?  REPLY: Are you referring to bio_urls.txt or bios.txt? REPLY: bios.txt is supposed to contain all sorts of information per each faculty member (i.e. Name, Contact Info, Education, etc.) and bio_urls.txt is supposed to contain the link that redirects you to the individual faculty pages. REPLY: Bio_urls.txt REPLY: Sorry bios.txt REPLY: bios.txt should have all of the info next to the faculty names, without the urls. Which is what <@U019ND33ZDY> said REPLY: bios.txt just needs one scraped text for a corresponding bio_urls.txt’s url. in my case I scraped just the expertise of the faculty and submitted (about probably 40-50 chars per line) . I got passed on the MP. REPLY: Yeah I passed it too Thanks for your help guys  
THREAD: For MP2.2, do we need to create individual txt files with average precision value for each query or just the mean average precision?  REPLY: It wants the individual AP's.  You'll need them in that form to do a t-test. REPLY: <@UCC3KEKU7> so, the file should contain multiple lines and each line corresponds to AP for each query right?  Also, I do get error when I try to do a t-test using scipy.stats  REPLY: Do we need to do any conversion when we read AP from files?  REPLY: That's what worked for me.  One per line. I used the R code, so I can't speak to how scipy.stats works.  The files were ready as-is for R. REPLY: Oh got you  REPLY: Thank you much  
THREAD: Guys do we have to use the web driver? Bc in the instruction does not say that we have to load that program, also I don’t find the driver for my current version of chrome  REPLY: what version of chrome are you using? REPLY: I didn't use it. I'm not even sure why they chose that approach...seems more complicated than simply using requests.get REPLY: I believe you need the webdriver for pages that render using javascript REPLY: good point...the website i chose didn't do that 
THREAD: MP2.1, does anyone know if the faculty page has individual URL's that are all different, can we manually save the bios? they are all custom webpages and would require a script for each individual person. REPLY: You'd have to ask an instructor, but I would think that kind of violates the spirit of the MP. Perhaps you should find a different school/department? REPLY: Yea, definitely not trying to skirt around anything. I wonder if others ran into the same issue and had to switch schools? REPLY: Clarification, i used beautifulsoup to scrape the URLs. So the code works for that, its just the bios links to URLs off the webpages to personal pages. REPLY: Yeah if what you're saying is that all the professors have custom webpages with different layouts, I would probably try to find a different college to work with REPLY: Roger, i changed school pages. thanks for the input <@URM1CGMR9> and <@U0187FAMNMR> REPLY: Cool, I think you'll thank yourself in the long run 
THREAD: for MP 2.1 how to access the signup sheet? It says use your Illinois email but the sheet is a google doc and not accepting the email REPLY: Refer to piazza post 211 REPLY: cool. That helped :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: You're welcome :blush:  
THREAD: I’m a bit behind and trying to plan my week... how involved is MP 2.1? Is it fairly straightforward or pretty difficult? REPLY: Its straight forward... sample code provided is 90% of coding done REPLY: Thank you! REPLY: Even if you forgot about the sample code and wrote all of it like I did, it's short and straightforward haha REPLY: Depends on the structure of the faculty web page you pick to some degree. Mine was very semantically structured HTML (no JS), so I did not have to write much custom scraping code to find the relevant elements. REPLY: It is straight forward. Took me less than 2hrs including setup 
THREAD: Is mp 2.3 out yet? REPLY: No it probably won't be until 2.1's due date as it uses the data from thart REPLY: that 
THREAD: For MP2.2, kindly clarify what c(t,D) means and how to implement it? REPLY: Count of the term t in document D. This is standard notation that the professor uses in week 4 lessons, check them before going for the HW (if you have not done so already).  REPLY: Thanks, oops completed MP2.2 already without week 4 lectures  :grinning: 
THREAD: I'm a little confused with the sign-up sheet. Can we pick a school in sign-up sheet or we have to find a school ourselves and enter them in the sign-up sheet? REPLY: Just ensure combination of school and dept that you choose doesn’t already exist in the sheet. At max there can be 5 duplicates. Once you know what combo you are going for, mention that in the sheet as in a new row.  REPLY: thank you that's helpful! 
THREAD: Has anyone done MP2.2? If so, what average precision do you get from InL2Ranker(c=1)? I got 0.2093382961003333 and autograder said my ranker was incorrect. I have no clue how to debug this... <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=351> REPLY: Double check your implementation of the formula in the score function REPLY:  It seems the autograder is not looking for the value but is looking for the implementation and then I think it is checking the p value 
THREAD: Guys how do you make the stopwold removal and steaming work? The first code give me an error when I try to read form the txt file  REPLY: What error do you get? I followed the same procedure and worked fine, so you mind posting your error here? Also, it may worth checking Piazza as well since other people had similar problem 
THREAD: Guys I’m confused in the MP1 the MeTA Toolkits is in the terminal?  REPLY: Ya you do it in the terminal!  REPLY: Yes <@U0147TVTF5E>, you must excute them on teminal. These command are useful when you do the actual assignment. The actual assignment is to write the code in example.py file.

THREAD: Hi, I'm planning on taking CS-410 in the Fall.  I'm trying to get a head start on the MOOC version of it now so I can take a second course that semester. It looks like the weeks match up, content-wise, except for the project at the end.  *Can anyone comment on how smoothly the 1) quizzes and 2) homeworks transfer over to the MCS-DS version of the course?  Are the lectures the same?* I note that the MOOC called _Text Retreval and Search Engines_ has two optional "Honors" programming assignments.  It looks like the first one is "build a search engine" using MeTA.  The second is a search engine competition.  Do these line up with the MCS-DS version's homeworks? REPLY: Search engine competition is present, however dataset etc will change. Much better to focus on the quizzes and get them transferred. lectures were the same for the first part in 2019; not sure if it changes in 2020. REPLY: Thanks... So were the lectures in the second part (weeks 7-12) the same too? REPLY: i think they were the same in 2019 REPLY: do all the quizzes transfer over? and what about the homework? REPLY: homework changes every time i guess; For e.g one of the homework i remember was extracting data from public pages..say prof bios..removing stopwords etc and then submitting it to create a dataset..and then using it to tweak search parameters used in creating the matrix..so these wont transfer as the code is autograded (Univ gitlab used) and these were different from the MOOC. For quizzes, they did; I had completed 1-2 weeks and they transferred over. REPLY: Hi <@UCC3KEKU7>, are you doing the paid version of the mooc here: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-retrieval>, or is this available separately freely for Illinois students (IIRC at Coursera@Illinois, though I am unable to find its link) REPLY: It's Coursera for Illinois.

Looks like you have selected to hold the transcript until the final grades are posted. Though we can see the final grade in the system not sure why that option is still showing while placing the order.

REPLY: Yes.  That gives you the COURSERA score.  Most of us are rather interested in the UofI grade. REPLY: yep, just noticed that you are dropping lowest 2 quizzes grades REPLY: I cant see my coursera score in this page REPLY: I was able to, but if you can't you have 2 other options to calculate it. This python script and my javascript code (shared in previous message today) REPLY: When I go to accomplishments, 410 doesn't show up, class is still listed as In-Progress and MP4 shows up as Overdue....  I pinged them about the MP4 grade since it sounds like many people are seeing grades there. REPLY: I have no idea whether it is required... but I submitted that MP4 thing to get rid of the Overdue status. REPLY: I believe it is due to mp4, there are a few students with the same problem on piazza, I did an empty submission but the overdue status is still there REPLY: Sigh... well hopefully they'll clean it all up within a couple of days. REPLY: I contacted coursera and the certificate showed up in my account minutes later 
THREAD: looks like the weights for the quizzes is wrong REPLY: I gave the corrected code in the thread 
THREAD: Are we getting our final grade tomorrow in Student portal? REPLY: actually that’s the due date, I think they said the student portal would have the grades the following date REPLY: Yes… but without the final grade, nothing official. 
THREAD: though that wouldn’t include extra credit REPLY: True, but gives an idea about the final grade. 
THREAD: Now that all grades are posted in Coursera, I couldn't find a place for final grade for the course there. This javascript calculates that: ```var final = 0.0; document.querySelectorAll('.rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow').forEach(function(row, i){   var weight = parseFloat(row.querySelector('.weight-column').textContent) || 0;   var grade = parseFloat(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent) || 0;   var calculated = grade * (weight/100);   final += calculated; }); alert('Final grade is: ' + final + '%');``` You can run it in the console or type `javascript: &lt;code&gt;` in the address bar and hit return. (Note: when you paste the code in address bar, some browsers strip `javascript:` and you'd have to manually type it again after pasting. ```javascript:var final=0;document.querySelectorAll(".rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow").forEach(function(e,t){var n=parseFloat(e.querySelector(".weight-column").textContent)||0,r=parseFloat(e.querySelector(".grade-column").textContent)||0;final+=r*(n/100)}),alert("Final grade is: "+final+"%");``` You could also save this as bookmark in your browser REPLY: If you didn't do MP4 you will get `NaN%`  Here is a fix:  ```var final = 0.0; document.querySelectorAll('.rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow').forEach(function(row, i){   var weight = parseInt(row.querySelector('.weight-column').textContent, 10);   var grade = parseInt(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent, 10);     if(weight === 0) return;   var calculated = grade * (weight/100);   final += calculated; }); alert('Final grade is: ' + final + '%');``` REPLY: ah I forgot `|| 0;`  in my grade/weight assignments ```var grade = parseInt(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent, 10) || 0;``` REPLY: Probably the better fix REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: no problem. Thanks for pointing out the issue and fixing :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: edited the original message REPLY: NOTE - For Chrome, putting this in the address bar did not work for me.  (redirected me to Google search...)  Worked fine from Console though.  Short Cut to Console [Windows] - CTRL-Shift-J  [Mac] - Not 100% sure, but "GoogleFu" indicates it is Command-Option-J REPLY: As I mentioned Chrome does strip the `javascript:` when you paste it, you just have to type it manually again after you paste REPLY: <@UMBMJ3B9N> I'm on Chrome and it worked using Sam's tip above... REPLY: You need to use parseFloat instead of parseInt , as MP2 grades are 2.5% each .  Use this corrected code. Otherwise the grades are little off by 2% REPLY: Awesome, makes my grade better :smile: REPLY: <@UM6RXU41J> - Good catch and when I run that version, grade matches what I calculated previously.  This looks good REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> - Maybe its my PC then?  Code works so all is good either way. REPLY: yep. Good catch <@UM6RXU41J> REPLY: updated :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: So, it turns out there is a place for final grade on Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/accomplishments> 
THREAD: Still missing my MP4 grade - anyone else? REPLY: Now, I see 98% but I don't know what does it mean. REPLY: for your reference  <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=1096> 
THREAD: where are you seeing the final grade? REPLY: Final grades are not published yet, grades on Coursera are based on Coursera grading logic but not university 
THREAD: I received my mp4 score now  REPLY: I got all grades REPLY: Not yet for me REPLY: <@ULVAVDCHJ> what is the status on your Technology Review Submission? Mine is still "Submitted".

THREAD: For those who have final project grades, are you the lead for your group (i.e. You submitted something on coursera)? REPLY: My project lead got it n other two haven't yet REPLY: I was NOT the project lead and  I received final project scores a few days ago.   REPLY: Same. I am not the project lead, but I received grades REPLY: No project grade for me yet either. My team lead got it though REPLY: My entire team got their project grade REPLY: Ok, sounds like it’s a mix. For my project, the lead got a grade but myself and the other non-lead have not REPLY: Yes, I got the grade and I am the lead and also my teammates got their grades. REPLY: My team got their grades. REPLY: I submitted for my team but I do not have grades yet. REPLY: All my team get final project grades. REPLY: I just checked and I have project scores now!  Only thing I don't seem to have anything for is MP4.  ( I did submit a program and beat baseline) 
THREAD: has anyone received completed status on coursera? usually when you finish the course or is close to it but have enough grades the course will be marked as complete and the certificate will be available. For me, this has not happened yet on this particular one.... REPLY: Yes, I have received the certificate from coursera when I completed my final exam. REPLY: Looks like I had a missing item, the reading in Week 15 (which basically says that this week has no content) was not maked as done, after that the course shows as complete, no certificate yet but may take a day to generate it. 
THREAD: I don't see my grades yet... Fingers crossed :blush: REPLY: Same here 
THREAD: Are you seeing grades on coursera or somewhere else? REPLY: on coursera REPLY: thx 
THREAD: Yeah, that might be best REPLY: maybe make sure they know it was done on time in your note or the readme... and the fork created afterwards...  they’ll be able to see when they look at the commit timestamps of your original project repo but just in case... :grinning:    Edited: to fix my horrible typos REPLY: Good suggestion! 
THREAD: Is it a requirement to upload the source code to a public repo? REPLY: I think so. Otherwise how could instructors or TAs access to the private repo? REPLY: Don’t they have the access to class Gitlab server. REPLY: Pushing to gitlab should be sufficient. The TAs have access to your repo. Also see <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=1135> REPLY: I talked to TA, it’s okay to upload to course_project.

They’re quite different from the open MOOCs, right? 
THREAD: For those who may have deployed a working version of their project remotely, did you provide documentation on how to build from scratch and run everything locally as well? or did you just provide an overview with a link to the online deployed app and basics of how to navigate? I'm assuming our final presentation will handle the detailed explanation of each piece... but don't want to come up short on the documentation piece... Thanks! REPLY: Our project is hosting in AWS and we only provide user guide without installation instruction. REPLY: Thank you! REPLY: We provided all  instructions... 
THREAD: Any one received Coursera certificate after exam 2? Usually Coursera send out a certificate with grade based on its own logic but this time I didn't get any email. REPLY: I did not receive for exam 1 either. REPLY: This is what I think : For STAT-420, while the TA/Professor setup the course and grades, they might have setup a minimum % to pass. The data analysis project was 20%. Say, if some had 75% already and the course minimum is 70% to obtain the completion certificate, one will receive the certificate immediately after the exam. But CS 410 may have higher minimum % or its not possible to get that minimum until the TAs update grades for final project. REPLY: I did receive the certificate immediately after exam 2.

THREAD: I guess the way ranker.score implemented somehow conflicts with flask REPLY: Thank you!  I think we're going to use vue, but with flask.. so maybe we'll need to try something different. REPLY: I am not an expert on these. This was the first time I used, but learned a lot while thinking that I was doing something wrong :joy: REPLY: Were you running the app locally using flask's integrated server? i.e. flask run . I've been googling and it sounds like maybe it's the integrated server that's an issue..but running on other servers is not.  Maybe once it's deployed to remote server it will work ?  We'll see..   You're right.. I'm learning a lot while troubleshooting, but I'm ready for it to work now :wink: REPLY: I saw that message too. I was running locally so never tried deploying it. I guess you should try and see. I was not sure if my app was fully functional or not. Now I know it works, maybe I will try with flask again. REPLY: I'm still trying to figure out how to run it locally using xampp or something else..  :wink: REPLY: In case anyone else runs into this same issue -- It was actually an easy fix that still took me a long time to figure out because all the specific examples I found seemed fairly complicated and complex...     I was able to use gunicorn to serve it up instead of the flask integrated server.. and it worked.  It was as easy as `pip install gunicorn` .   then `gunicorn app:app` at the command line (i.e. gunicorn [filename]:app) . 
THREAD: What tools is everyone using for the project presentation?  Are you having one team member narrate or combining separate audio files?  I've used Quicktime screen capture for previous classes, but curious what everyone recommends if we have multiple team members contributing.  Is there something 'built-in' that makes this easy?  (I'm on a Mac).. REPLY: We are planning a single narrator with Powerpoint behind it, record and produce video.... 
THREAD: Hey, Do you folks know if we get any discount or access to deeplearning VMs like Azure DSVM or Google's Deep Learning VM? REPLY: Yes. You get credits with your school account. We are using them. REPLY: Specifically for Azure. Info is online REPLY: Thanks Alan. Its 100$ credit right? Unfortunately 100$ lasted only for few days for a VM with GPU. REPLY: Yes, you need to shut it down. There are options to have it shut down automatically. It costs about $450 / month to run a standard VM continuously. REPLY: There are other options for deployment using platform as a service as well which will be cheaper. Not sure what you are using your VM for. REPLY: If you are doing ML, then consider using the Azure ML service. You should be able to run experiments well within the $100/month. REPLY: Awesome. Thank you. I used DSVM before so was checking about that (As I need Tensorflow and PyTorch support). Will explore Azure ML REPLY: Yes, I believe both are supported with Azure ML

THREAD: Week 11 quiz can someone help me understand actual values to be substituted for this Assume that documents are being classified into two categories, c1 and c2, such that a document can belong to more than one category. The table below shows the prediction of a classifier, denoted by "y" or "n", in addition to the true label (ground truth) represented by a "+" or "-", where a correct prediction is either y (+) or n (-). c1 c2 D1 y(+) y(+) D2 n(-) y(+) D3 n(+) n(-) D4 y(-) y(+) D5 n(+) n(-) Given the same data as in Question 1, the classification accuracy of the classifier is: REPLY: So one of the slides has accuracy as (total correct)/(total decisions) REPLY: That would mean: ```(# y(+) + #n(-)) ----------------       total``` REPLY: 11.3 video slide "Classification Accuracy (Percentage of correct decisions)"  Does that help? REPLY: Also read y(-) as false positive instead of n(+) Similarly n(+) is false negative instead of y(-). I used to get confused so just sharing. Will be helpful when you calculate precision and recall REPLY: + and - are human categorization

REPLY: <@UJAFNBRGX> Are you not reading the textbook or any additional readings the professor was giving? REPLY: Looks like the exam is comparatively easy than mid exam REPLY: any multi answer multiple choice? REPLY: Yes few questions REPLY: Take those practice quizzes until you can recite them in your sleep.  Happy I did and was able to calculate everything on them by hand. REPLY: True. Make sure to review the quizzes. I felt that most questions mirrored the quiz questions REPLY: is it better to focus on the real quizzes or practice quizzes for review? I always feel like the practice ones are easier REPLY: Both REPLY: Need to remember the formulas? REPLY: The ones in the quizzes

I know it is a broad question but like to understand in terms of (1) Course difficulty (2) Programming Load etc. 410- was my first intro course to MCS-DS, will be taking the finals in the next couple of days. REPLY: I'm on the same boat and taking CCA next semester. From what I heard it is doesn't require as much time as 410 (something I really don't have next quarter) REPLY: Thanks Sam! REPLY: 412 is on par workload-wise with 410.  Good class, lots of programming assignments, lots of stats.  Some crossover with 410 concepts.  REPLY: I found 412 to be a heavier load than 410 and a friend agreed it was one of the more challenging courses in the program.  There are crossover concepts, which I feel were covered better than in 410.  My .02... REPLY: thanks so much!!!

THREAD: <@UM5B71WMA>  Me too! glad i’m not alone.  I’m trying to decide what parts are just “lost causes” for the short term and what I should focus on instead.  But i’m getting burnt and wondering if i should just take what I can now without throwing more time into it.  I still have project work to get through.... I learned a lot, but some of the lectures and slides....  wow... REPLY: What helps me is I just ignore the crazy formulas and rewrite the formula into what it is trying to accomplish so that I get the concept first and then drill into each piece's underlying math.  In some of the lectures he does a decent job of verbalizing what is happening, but the slide is just a bunch of crazy looking formulas which makes it harder to review later if you didn't make good note.  Judging from the mid-term and what he has said about the class, it seems if you understand what the formula is trying to do at a high level, you are A-OK. 
THREAD: do you get a grade though? REPLY: Yes but I’m the mid term I saw the questions I missed. Not this time :( REPLY: the good news is that, the final isn’t so heavily waited. So as long as you didn’t get a zero, you can still get an A in this class. i think with the extra credits, even with a zero, you can get an A. REPLY: I just wanted to see what I got wrong 
THREAD: but i didn't see that in the final i have no clue which ones i missed REPLY: How was it? Is it from weekly quizzes? REPLY: Def easier than the mid term REPLY: More quiz-like questions on the final.

REPLY: I would work for Google first for at least a couple years. Then start own company. REPLY: Follow your heart :heart:. If you have a good idea want to pursue, don’t wait!!! You could be the next Google. If you have an offer from big companies like Google, then it’s always good to have experience to work with such great companies.

If you are hired by google now you can definitely crack google or similar companies latter in your life as well. REPLY: Following the heart is definitely  an motivating factor!

Team formation (5%)  Project proposal (10%)  Software code submission with documentation (65%): &gt;  The documentation should cover both how to use the software and how the software is implemented. &gt;   45% for source code submission; 20% for documentation submission. Both would be graded based on completion, and should be submitted through GitLab. Software usage tutorial presentation (20%)

THREAD: Speaking of taking 2 courses, Stanford's NLP course (which is all free except obviously you can't get your work graded or a credential for it) looks SO COOL and so complementary to this course (more recent applications, lots of deep learning, builds well on top of the foundation we get here). But where would I find the time to do it :books::books: <http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/> REPLY: I did my Tech Review on that :) REPLY: Such a cool tool. I think its the best in NLP business.

For reference, my only feedback was: "What does your timeline look like?" REPLY: I guess mine doesn't have any feedback then. 
THREAD: Has anyone in here also taken Intro to Data Mining (CS 412)? If so, how do they compare? REPLY: 412 was a better course IMO.  I believe there were 6 MPs and 2 exams.  2-sided cheat sheet for exams.  MPs were programmed from scratch and no libraries,  It has its challenging parts to be sure, but no BS paper or project, and it was organized.  Really good TAs.  It was my first course in the program so it was a tidal wave of new information and learning to program in Python.  Missed an A- by .5 pts.  Quality lectures, and no 31 minute videos.   Oh, and he uses good examples so you’re not left figuring out something as abstract as PLSA from a complex math problem.   To be fair, I’ve learned a lot from both courses.  REPLY: what do you mean 2-sided cheat sheet? REPLY: You can use both sides of a 8.5 x 11" paper to put notes on for your exams.  TBH, it wasn't as helpful as it sounds since the exams were largely conceptual rather than applying formulas.  I believe you could also take the weekly quizzes an unlimited amount of times, not just the practice quizzes. REPLY: Cool. Comparable work level? REPLY: At times I felt like this class is more work, but it's probably comparable and just spaced out differently. REPLY: was that the 412 exam or 410? I thought you couldn't have any notes for the 410? REPLY: When I took 412 this spring you could have the cheat sheet, and a restroom break, during the two exams. REPLY: CS412 is a great course and I would highly recommend it. Personally I found Prof. Zhai's lectures in CS410 to be a lot better than the one by Prof. Han's in CS412. While going through CS412 lectures, I always felt like something was missing and had to refer the book to complete my understanding. That's probably the only issue I had with CS412. 
THREAD: Who is also taking this class as their first class in MCSDS? What are you taking as your next class? REPLY: Am taking CCA REPLY: this is my first. i'm registered to CS498 Cloud Computing Applications next REPLY: this was my first class. ABM next REPLY: CCA- Get ready for Hadoop map-reduce, and spark map-reduce , apachi Storm , redis,  cassandra and lots more stuff types of Database in memory mainly-- Lots of programming assigmnets in Java or python pick your poison ! Good luck REPLY: sounds like fun! REPLY: Awesome! I think I will be taking that class as well. CCA. REPLY: ...and oh yeah you have to do your report in IEEE format... So get familiar with that if you are not already. REPLY: This is my first semester (410 / 425 value pak!) Taking 445 next REPLY: CCA sounds like interesting stuff, though. REPLY: Which one is 445? REPLY: I am taking this class together with Cloud Networking for my first semester. I plan to take computational photographic next. REPLY: <@UMW0NBSDT> Computational Photography REPLY: Maybe is fun, I don't know if I want to deal with these problems tho REPLY: You also get AWS  basic assignments. deploying instanses /clusters adding load balancers  parallel computing batch processing. Its fun REPLY: My first semester--took it with 425. Next semester is Intro to Data Mining and Computational Photography. REPLY: My first sem - 410 and 598(Data curation). Going to take CCA and Computational Photography in next one 
THREAD: Pradeep - I didn't go through the first study guide in great detail, but it seemed like study guide touched all of the main areas.  More detail than on the coursera test for sure.  The Exam 2 study guide is pretty big and had something like ~50 different key points, some of which had lengthy explanations.  Pretty sure the Exam 2 on Coursera is another 20 questions.  I think it will cover everything on the test; however, not sure you'll have a clue where the 20 questions will come from.  (assume PLSA, CPLSA, though, etc.)  I Did "OK" on Exam 1, but I generally suck on multiple choice questions so these are sub-optimal for me. REPLY: Where did you find the exam 2 study guide? REPLY: yeah where did you find the study guide? i don't see it on Coursera REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=966> 
THREAD: The person I _want_ to be would take it before Dec. 7th, but the person I actually am needs to take it right before the due date :sweat_smile: REPLY: This time I started telling myself "I am not going to leave it til last minute" early on, so that's an improvement. (this doesn't affect the fact that I will take it last minute) 
THREAD: I need a few more days for the tech review. On Piazza, one of the TAs said "Just please let us know that you will be submitting your work later [...] a private post on Piazza will suffice." How do I send a private post on Piazza? Any ideas? Thanks. REPLY: Oh, I suppose it just means I send it to all the Instructors. 
THREAD: They're the same... REPLY: Ok.  Why would they be the same? REPLY: Because the probability of not finding "photon" is 1-.01 = 0.99 which is the same as the probability of finding "the" 
THREAD: Part 2 of this course is really hard to grasp and remember things, don't know how would I be able to remember things for exam 2. Do we need to get any passing score in exam? REPLY: I have hard time understanding too, have been going through videos again and again in repetition REPLY: yeah have to watch these a couple of times and more important, make a Legend for what all of the special characters stand for as well as key formula components.  I try to re-write all of the formulas in english and walk through a simple sample to help understand.  It doesn't help when some of the letters used previously are re-hashed here for a different meaning. 
THREAD: only criteria i saw was 600 words REPLY: where was the 600 words criteria posted? I must have missed that REPLY: I saw that too..somewhere on Piazza I think... REPLY: Yea, comments over here mention ~2 pages:<https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=896> And then comments here say minimum 600 words: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=389> REPLY: My group noticed that in the grades section, the technology review was listed as 10% of the grade, but that seemed inconsistent with something else I had read.  But then again, inconsistency has been pretty rampant. REPLY: I read somewhere that tech review will not have any credit score REPLY: ^ Credit is only for doing it and not for the quality of the writing etc.. REPLY: Stanford Zhou 5 days ago There's no hard limit, but around 2 pages is expected. 
THREAD: How formal are people generally getting with their tech reviews? The two examples shown are of wildly varying quality, depth, formality and formatting. Also not sure if I should be writing out references in an academic or informal style. REPLY: I formatted my references in formal 'academic' style, but the paper itself was less formal.  Mine was probably somewhere between the two examples.  I definitely put time into writing it, but most of the effort was put into learning about the tool and trying it out for myself.  I  didn't try to "rework" it as much as I would have if I knew we were being graded on the actual writing rather than just completion. To be honest, I would be surprised if they even have the time to read them. REPLY: For only two pages of content I kept it relatively shallow on the tool technicalities and spent most of the paper describing new situations that could benefit from the tool. REPLY: I did not go crazy on the formatting of references as one of the samples provided on Coursera hardly used a formal format.  Just did standard Title, Author, Date, URL/Doc pointer in a consistent format for all of them. 
THREAD: Thoughts on MP4 in terms of difficulty or how long it takes to beat baseline? REPLY: 10 mins to break baseline:) REPLY: hmm.. it's taking me more than 10 minutes to figure out what I have to do.. :wink: REPLY: I won't even go there considering MP3 took me  more than a decade to finish REPLY: I would say try it, it's easy to break baseline at least and you will get 2% credit, I tried to come in top 10 in the list working few hours n then gave up being happy with 2% but yeah MP3 gave me restless nights REPLY: ok.. 20 minutes to tie the baseline... REPLY: agreed, MP4 is easy and 2% REPLY: Took me a few minutes to figure out what to do, but now agree...  it’s an easy few extra points... REPLY: Any of you actually look at the content of train.dat....  Gotta love Twitter users, lol. REPLY: Yes!  I was trying to figure out how we could actually group those by location.  It’s not like there were regional slang words in there that I saw... it was *all* inappropriate references, abbreviated slang and curse words..  REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> and <@UJAFNBRGX> did you guys play around with the Analyzers? I can't seem to get it to beat the baseline, my performance only goes down. Any tips? REPLY: I experimented with the analyzers, and made a few 'small' changes that seemed to bump my score up some.  In the end I did a lot of playing around with classifiers and some other parameters and scores went up and then down...  I'm not sure the small changes I made to the config.toml file really mattered in the end. :wink: REPLY: a minute after i posted, I revisted my toml file and found an error. Fixed that and everything worked. Thanks for the response though REPLY: i was able to beat the baseline for MP4 it was super easy. REPLY: How much time did you spend??? REPLY: Any tips?? 
THREAD: I am curious to know how everyone is feeling about their final projects.  I sat down today to get a trial done and ended up finishing the product in about 100 lines of python.  Is that 'too short' of a project compared to yours?  I built a customizable web scraper for application in my career field. REPLY: I think lines of code should not matter as far as project is related to current course and there is a learning. For eg except MP3 other assignments had learning but code was very minimal. In our project also we will end up with around 100 to 150 lines that's all REPLY: Based on what I heard from the office hours, they expect 40 hours of work. REPLY: At least your progress report will be easy to write: "Done." REPLY: 40 hours seems crazy...unless I design an entire GUI + webpage to go along with it. REPLY: I believe 40hrs of work also include debugging code etc REPLY: It also include preparing project doc, video etc REPLY: It is a lot of work. But it is worth 20% of grade. REPLY: I assume you haven’t gotten feedback yet on your project proposal? That will probably give you your answer. If the scope is acceptable, then the time to finish shouldn’t be an issue.  REPLY: Not sure any of us are going to end up getting feedback before the project is due, TBH... REPLY: cc <@UJ54TNBDZ> 
THREAD: just checked the plagiarism detection, apparently i have 1% similarity REPLY: hmm never done that. how do you do that?

Interesting, but it was a technical sentence so only so many ways to write it coherently, I guess. 
THREAD: Anybody scheduled exam 2 ? REPLY: Not yet REPLY: Ok, any idea what are the dates for Exam 2? REPLY: Yes REPLY: Exam 2 opens this morning and I believe ends by Dec 10th REPLY: Yup 
THREAD: Anyone is still looking to join a project group. My project team member had to drop the class and now I am looking for another team member. REPLY: What is your team working on? I have sent a message to the TA's/Instructor about changing my project topic but they haven't responded.  I may be interested if the spot is still open (I can send you details on background etc to see if that would fit in with your needs and project).

THREAD: I am having problem understanding the fact that why do I exceed # of iterations in gitlab when I specify that I want my code to run 150 iterations ? Does anyone have this issue ? In gitlab I am seeing iteration running upto 391. REPLY: Your max iteration is not used in the unittests, there might be other value set by the test. You need to break when the threshold is exceeded (difference in likelihood &lt; epsilon) REPLY: But if I apply this logic i.e likelihood&lt;epsilon then I can't get the result because epsilon value is 0.001 and likelihood cannot be less than epsilon. REPLY: The goal is to get the DELTA likelihood less than epsilon.  That's why Sam said "difference in likelihood".  You must somehow keep track of the likehood values so you can compare the current iteration's value with the previous iteration's value. REPLY: abs(new_ll - old_ll) &lt; epsilon REPLY: just be sure how you do that as well. REPLY: if your returning and appending current value, you want make sure you are indexing the correct place in your list. REPLY: I don't think we should use abs() while finding the difference of the likelihoods. If the algorithm is correct then the new likelihood will always be greater then the old one making the difference always positive. If it's negative at any point it points to a defect in the code. Using abs() will hide this making debugging more difficult. REPLY: Thank you everyone for the help I was able to pass MP3 
THREAD: I am having a really hard time trying to figure out how to calculate P(z | d), can anyone point me in the right direction. the fact that the algorithm in the slides considers a background model and the mp does not is really confusing REPLY: P(z | d) is the product term_doc_matrix and topic_prob loops running from (number of docs) and (number of (topics) and (vocab size). After this you need to normalize it over the document ids. REPLY: if you are interested, you can take a look of @799 in MP3 of piazza. 
THREAD: Still need help with the term-doc matrix....python is not my strong suit and everything I'm trying isnt working. REPLY: since the value should be a count, not a list REPLY: (at some point I should probably warn that I've had a few beers which had a higher alcohol by volume than I initially suspected, so take anything I say with a grain of salt) REPLY: haha i need to have a beer REPLY: well I was watching the Panthers game so :disappointed: REPLY: i feel that on a spiritual level, currently listening to the Rams game REPLY: current output I am getting REPLY: if you have six terms that would be terms [0 - 5] REPLY: there wouldn't be an index of 6 REPLY: I dont see where it's picking up the extra index though REPLY: y = 0 is on the wrong line REPLY: if you are going to do it that way, you need to reset y after each document or it is going to keep increasing forever REPLY: your loop could also use range and that would prevent the need for extra variables and issues like this REPLY: ahh thank you REPLY: for currI in range (0, i): REPLY: if you had 4 documents (i=4) the command above iterates 0, 1, 2, 3 REPLY: no need for counter variables, clearing logic, etc. REPLY: got it! okay finally got the matrix to work!!! thank you guys! REPLY: and i was defined as :  i = len(self.documents)  for currI in range (0, i):  NOTE - I created an "i" variable since I was using self.documents / document count in multiple places and I didn't want to keep counting it over and over again. REPLY: so for the initialize_randomly function, i need to initialize the matrices right? REPLY: Yeah, use the np.random.random function, but don't forget to normalize 
THREAD: So who else is having fun right about now ? :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I am.

REPLY: 1 ESTEP for each topic.  My understanding is the word_topic_prob distribution represents the word probabilities for Both Topic and Every step should update both Topic word distributions simultaniously...Let me now if i'm wrong? REPLY: so the topic_prob should be a three dimensional array, one dimension representing words, one documents, and one topics REPLY: sorry I meant to say topic_word_prob. 
THREAD: Just got mine working. I'd recommend double checking all the matrices. For me I made a silly mistake on the term-document matrix. REPLY: Did your likelihood converge even with the mistake you had? I am trying to see if this is similar to my case. I keep trying different things with the calculations and steps but I kind of think that maybe something else is wrong. Mine converges above 100 iteration and I end up with a likelihood difference less that epsilon, but pipeline tests timeout. REPLY: Yes, mine did. It worked after I closely examined all my code before the E-step. 
THREAD: Anybody tried matrix operations instead of for-loops ? Say in likelihood calculation ? Staring at the summation equation from couple of hours ... But nah ... :confused: REPLY: Never got ```np.dot``` to work. As a hint, however, ```np.einsum``` is much easier and more intuitive. 
THREAD: I am appending the log likelihood to the self.likelihood but when i am calculating the likelihood, when should I take the log ? REPLY: Maybe check out the last comment on this Piazza thread:  <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=730> REPLY: thnx <@ULZRHS1LP> 
THREAD: Any idea what might be going wrong here: My likelihood difference converges to the value of epsilon, but not within 50 iterations for test dataset REPLY: It might not be within 50... try 150 and see if that works. Mine was converging at a little over 100.. give or take depending on the random initialization.. REPLY: ^the pipeline won't use that max iterations variable -- that's just for testing.. REPLY: it converges around 110-140 for me, but can't get tests to pass. So, thanks for confirming tests could pass even when test dataset takes more iterations REPLY: (assuming your tests are passing :slightly_smiling_face:) REPLY: ^ They did :wink: . REPLY: yeah, they just timeout for me REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> Do you use number_of_topics in your E-step? REPLY: I don't. I originally added it in but was afraid it would affect the grader (others have said it doesn't), so I didn't use it. I update the entire column of my matrix (for each document/term combination) at once so I didn't need to count topic rows.  My code is a mix of different "whatever works" methods.. REPLY: Thank you Stephanie! I am now wondering if my simple vocabulary/documents and count building is the issue. I have tried so many different ways and still getting similar results in terms of convergence. But tests fail... 
THREAD: Any tips on getting the TAs to respond to a private message/question on piazza? I asked one about the exam right after taking it (so two weeks ago now) and have not received any response yet. I tried commenting on the post and making it again REPLY: Send a message to mcs-support if you don’t get a response on Piazza. REPLY: They'll respond at that email even for something course (and not logistics) related? REPLY: Yes, it will get routed to the instructors for the particular course and I guess they have some kind of SLA around response times. REPLY: Worked for me anyway :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Awesome. Thanks 
THREAD: So when you collect your z values from ESTEP they have to be normalized? I thought the ESTP equation normalized the values in the "denominator" REPLY: It's my understanding that the denominator normalizes it. REPLY: Precisely. The denominator does the normalization but can be done in a separate step. 
THREAD: is this the E-STP formula we need to implement? We don't need the Background, right? REPLY: that's correct, anytime you see that =B formula you can essentially ignore it from the equation because the probability of using it is 0 for our case REPLY: So we are updating both distributions at the same time in the ESTEP? REPLY: you're updating 1 matrix (the z values, topic_prob) using the other 2 matrix (topic_word_prob and document_topic_prob) REPLY: #T = self.topic_word_prob         #D = self.document_topic_prob         #E-step computes all Z's based on T and D REPLY: ^ that's from the readme i think REPLY: in the M-step, you update T and D using the Z values and the word count of the docs (term_doc_matrix) REPLY: Sorry, wrong question now thta I think about it REPLY: What I meant to ask was on each iteration of the ESTEP 2 seperate distributions? which will result in a [1000, 2, 6] matrix REPLY: [[[1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6]], [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6]]... -&gt; 1000]

I couldn’t call the number_of_topic because its not defined in the e-step. Do you have any idea what I can do here to get 2 step iteration? REPLY: Nevermind, I figured out that part. 
THREAD: Hi again, can someone please explain to me how the normalization work in the e-step code wise? I have the numerator as {1000 *6} but stuck at getting topic_prod to [1000*6*2] matrix. REPLY: It should be [1000x2x6], you can see the variables expected in the PLSA function when it is initialized. 
THREAD: Hi, I am trying to map/understand these variables to 'EM' formulas. *document_topic_prob* = None  # P(z | d)  *topic_word_prob* = None  # P(w | z),  *topic_prob* // is it p(theta sub d) REPLY: document topic prob = for each 1,000 documents, probability that the document is related to each topic (2 columns because 2 topics for the test data) (symbol with the pie) REPLY: topic word prob = probability that a given word is related to a topic (symbols p(n)(w | 0j)) REPLY: topic prob = basically a combination of the above two. Dimensions are (1000, 2, 6) for the test data. p(z d, w = j)

THREAD: Update: I think my issue is due to this issue(<https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=825>) any tips on how to fix reading of empty lines? I have added some logic, but it doesn't seem to help REPLY: I just used readlines and split('\n\t'). REPLY: split or strip? REPLY: have you tested against DBLP? REPLY: I used "with open ... as xx". Then for line in xx stripped the line first and split the line at spaces. I didn't specify anything for line end character. I passed the pipeline REPLY: Ohh I also checked if the returned array length was greater than zero. Maybe that avoided empty rows REPLY: I used split to split the lines at \t and \n.... REPLY: I figured it out, my issue was getting all the unique terms it was ok with test, but not with dblp fixed that and now I have no issue 
THREAD: is there a good way to troubleshoot, I feel like i'm shooting in the dark since I don't know why its failing? The first test passes, but the next 3 fail on the first iteration, not sure what's going on :man-shrugging: REPLY: Add print statements when in doubt, they will print in console output of the git pipeline as well REPLY: thanks, i wasn't sure if that was allowed, my pipelines have passed! REPLY: Read only 5-10 documents from the test set and print everything. The patterns should become clear.  
THREAD: E-step: Can someone explain to me summation in the denominator using numpy? I saw from reading posts that we should be normalizing through the columns not rows, this got me confused. I understand the multiplication of the 2 matrices using  np.dot(doc_topic_prod, topic_word), however, how would I iterate over the k topics ie. the summation? REPLY: i think you would use matmul instead 
THREAD: Can somebody explain what term-doc-matrix mean in terms of its structure? REPLY: It will be a matrix of length # of documents and width # terms in the vocabulary. REPLY: thanks REPLY: just to make sure, something like this? REPLY: Yes, exactly. 
THREAD: if we use for loops instead of numpy multiplication will that kill performance? i thought i had it correctly, but I fooled myself and now i'm struggling to make sense of how to multiply and add everything REPLY: I used numpy once, but mostly stuck to looping just because I wanted to be able to debug at each step and it was easier for me to think it through in loops. It worked fine and wasn't too slow on this particular set of test documents. Now that I've passed, I'm going back in to see if there's anywhere I can substitute in numpy... REPLY: kinda what i was thinking, i went the numpy route thinking it would fail with loops REPLY: i'll give it another 30 mins or so then do just straight loops REPLY: Thinking about it all makes my brain explode... REPLY: I was able to refactor after I got it to pass and now i have was using numpy multiplication for everything except the log likelihood which I'm not sure how to approach it. REPLY: I didn't use numpy at all and a passing pipeline ran pretty quick (although I never tested locally against the large dataset). Same as Stephanie I found it a lot easier to go step by step and understand what I was doing. It's been years since I've done anything with matrices :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: is it possible for the denominator to be 0? REPLY: I which case you are getting it 0? Denominator should not be 0 resulting in infinity. If all probabilities are 0 in a row then you need to randomize and normalize it to have non zero values REPLY: seems like i'm getting it in the m-step REPLY: There is a piazza post about this. Seems like there are some empty lines in the test data in the pipeline, so if you are splitting on newline you will get empty rows. That might be causing the zeros REPLY: ohhhhh 
THREAD: should log likelihood values be between 0 &amp; 1? REPLY: the likelihood will be between 0 and 1.  the log of that will be between negative infinity and 0 REPLY: ok i was seeing numbers like -100K or something and didn't know if that was the reason the pipeline is failing 
THREAD: Need help with generating the Term_doc_matrix: I tried using the For loop and Scipy,sparse_csr_matrix() but couldn’t the count of terms, Can anyone share a resource  that I can use to get this going? Any help is much appreciated REPLY: I completed it using pandas, but its failing because that module cannot be found ugh REPLY: sometimes scipy/numpy can be hard to work with. have you tried for loop and hash? REPLY: I have not the tried the hash. What class would I need to import for the hash <@UMWDN7SLQ>? REPLY: for small data set and to pass this MP3, you can use Counter on each document from  self.documents in one list comprehension (outer one).  Counter will return a set of key:value pairs.  Key is the term, and value is the frequency.  Then in another list comprehension (inter one), you extract the frequency by Counter(doc)[key] where key is term from self.vocabulary.  So you have two list comprehensions, one inside the other.  The result will be list of lists.  To convert it into matrix, use np.array.  This is just a one line code, ok for small data set, but not efficient for large data set.    Scipy,sparse_csr_matrix() is the way to go for large data set as it has been used in CountVectorizer from sklearn. REPLY: hash is build in python. it's a dictionary. for each word in each doc increment the counter that is stored in hash REPLY: Thank you. You guys are awesome! 
THREAD: OMG i passed…I really read into those equations and did a lot changes on the normalization:mario_luigi_dance: REPLY: what kindof changes in normalization? i am totally stuck in normalization. REPLY: I felt the same  like OMG when I passed tests REPLY: <@UJ4DCCYJK> mainly the M-step. M-step normalization is different than the initial step. I used the course slides and make sure all the denominators on the equations are correct REPLY: <@UJEU26EE5> ok.. let me check. REPLY: MP3 is the most challenging assignment by far. REPLY: Congratulations! REPLY: so we are supposed to normalize at the end of the E &amp;M-steps? I'm assuming its only the probabilities we are calculating for those functions we have to? REPLY: Yes - I had to normalize E and M (once for each step in M).  Yes, once you've calculated the probabilities you need to normalize across the row or column as appropriate. REPLY: <@UJEU26EE5>, do you mean that in the M step, we can not directly call self.topic_word_prob = normalize(self.topic_word_prob) and self.document_topic_prob = normalize(self.document_topic_prob) REPLY: <@UJ3PWQF46> Yes.  I wrote my own normalization for M step REPLY: Pretty wired. M step should be row level normalization. Why do you need to do different normalization. Could you explain the difference? REPLY: I used the provided normalize function for all normalizations. Performed transformations prior to ensure normalization happens across the correct dimension. This might not have been most efficient because on the big dataset my program was only on iteration #39 by morning. :-) 
THREAD: For stopping condition of the likelihood function, should I use `np.abs(curr_ll - prev_ll)` or should I use `np.abs((cur_ll - prev_ll) / preb_ll)` REPLY: No need to do the ratio, just abs(diff) is fine. REPLY: ^ agree.  This is what I used and passed.  There was another student on piazza that was getting incorrect results using the relative error formula. REPLY: I used the first out of your two options, and passed. 
THREAD: No, you need to customize your own normalization if needed. The given one is row-sum type. You can't use it for all scenario unless you want to keep trap of matrix transpose if you use it.  Sometime we need column-sum type.  Also sometime the normalization is a single value for all matrix elements.  In this case you can't use the given one.  The give one will return a matrix. REPLY: that is sneaky… i almost think that i should’ve used it all the time REPLY: but what about the `initialize_randomly` step? I figured these two matrices should be normalized row wise .. am i right? REPLY: I used the provided normalize() function there....  and now i’m thinking i could have used it in a few other places instead of looping and summing.... REPLY: haha,. I’m still experimenting REPLY: you can use it all the time but you have to design all your matrices in such a way that you can normalise by row or you need to do transformations before you normalise then put it back into shape REPLY: I think it's much easier to build your own normalisation function REPLY: I understand that in E step, it's column wise normalization. However, in M step, both those 2 normalization should be column wise right. If so, why cann't we use this function in M step? REPLY: Yes, I used the provided normalize function for all normalizations. Performed transformations prior to ensure normalization happens across the correct dimension. This might not have been most efficient because on the big dataset my program was only on iteration #39 by morning. :-) 
THREAD: E step is commented as updating P(z | w, d)...But variable self.topic_prob is commented as P(z | d, w).  Is it a typo or am I missing something in which variable to update? Also why doesn't np.dot accomplish this step if all I need is a product between two probability variables? REPLY: New issue: confused on how to turn a (1000,6) shape from np.dot into a (1000,2,6) shape for topic_prob.  Any advice is appreciated! REPLY: How many (1000,6) are in a (1000, 2, 6)? That should point you in the right direction REPLY: For those of you stuck, I finally passed after three hopeless nights.  My major solution was using this format instead of np.dot for multiplication:  self.topic_prob[a,b,c] = self.topic_word_prob[b,c] * self.document_topic_prob[a,b] REPLY: Thanks <@ULQ0GTSBC> for sharing this. But after this step, you still need to normalize the value by column right? REPLY: I ended up manually normalizing with loops and a denominator value.  I only used the given normalization function for initialize_randomly 
THREAD: has anyone had an issue with their LL values becoming smaller rather than larger after just 1-4 iterations through the test.txt data? Not sure what step the issue might be in. I suspect the M-step REPLY: mine goes more negative and then increases after that REPLY: are you passing the pipeline tests? I made some more changes and my LL now increases until it gets really close to zero on the test set, but doesn't pass the tests REPLY: it's my understanding that it should never get more negative if implemented correctly REPLY: yes - passed this morning :slightly_smiling_face:  darn for loop, python indents and terminology headaches... REPLY: did it pass going more negative then increasing? or did you fix that? REPLY: yes in general lower to higher but some variations as it moved along REPLY: hmm i think i have similar issue for my solution... REPLY: Might have solved already, but this happened to me when I was normalizing across the wrong dimension.  
THREAD: <https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/EMAlgorithm.html>   this example seems helpful for the programming assignmnet REPLY: That looks like a decent explanation. I finally got mine working.. it's not pretty.  I ran across a lot of examples of the EM algorithm in other areas so it seems like it would be a good general concept to understand more. REPLY: Not sure if this is cheating or not in that I would spend just as much time trying to understand it. Just looking through the solution I can see how my program could be improved.  REPLY: yeh i’m not a big fan for implementing algorithm but i guess that is the gist of the course… :joy: i used a EM library for some task before 
THREAD: has everyone been pushing their changes onto their master branch? I've done all my work on a separate branch and got a 0 on parts 1 and 2 bc of it (at least I'm hoping that's the reason). To my knowledge, it doesn't say everything has to go to the master branch anywhere REPLY: I've been pushing to master. Mostly just because I'm git-naive... REPLY: Does it go through the ci pipeline on other branches? REPLY: it does. the pipelines seem to be kicked off whenever a new commit is registered, regardless of branch REPLY: Then I'd recommend commenting on <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=774> REPLY: I have, posted here right after in case other's had the same issue REPLY: I pushed to master assuming their ci would not run on other branches. Looks like my laziness saved me 
THREAD: I have not received the grade for Mp2-part 3 REPLY: I haven't received grade for MP2-part3 as well. But, for MP2-part1 I received grade as 100%. Are you seeing grade for MP2-part1? REPLY: Yes. I have the grade for both part 1, 2 4 REPLY: They are having issues for part3, they are working to fix it. REPLY: Why all the weight's are showing as 0% for graded MP's on Coursera? REPLY: I have no grade for mp2-part3 either 
THREAD: Anyone seeing weight as 0% and Grade as 0% for MP2-part1 under Coursera grades? REPLY: And for all MP's weight's are showing as 0% in Coursera REPLY: I'm seeing grade 100% but weight 0% REPLY: Are you seeing grade as 100% for MP2-part1? REPLY: I am seeing grade 100%, weight 0% for MP2-part1 REPLY: It got corrected now. I misspelled bois.txt instead of bios.txt for MP2-part1. Now, the grade is adjusted on Coursera. REPLY: Hey Siva, on making the change to the file name, in how much time you received the updated coursera grades. I did a mistake in placing significance.txt inside an existing folder. REPLY: TA adjusted the grade immediately and reflected the change in Coursera. 
THREAD: ^ This. The answers on Piazza keep referring back to the original response that says "tentatively next week" which was 2 weeks ago.  I'm inclined to just go forward.  Anyone else procrastinating like me? REPLY: Definitely.  Or maybe just realizing that I'm behind on the coursework in general at this point.  lol. REPLY: Yes, not for lack of work.  I'm not in love with my project idea anymore... may try to change it up. REPLY: Not procrastinating, just a matter of competing priorities and the fear of wasting time on something that hasn't been approved yet.  With that said, our group is going to have a meeting Friday to start dividing up tasks, etc.  Don't think we can afford to wait too much longer on feedback for fear of not enough time to complete project. 
THREAD: For the test.txt corpus, should I see convergence in &lt;50 iterations?   Right now I'm seeing convergence at just over 100 iterations...  Does it seem like I have an issue somewhere? REPLY: I have asked the same question on Piazza and the response was no we don't have to get convergence in 50 iteration, that's not the expectation. Having more iteration for convergence also do not mean your code has issues. Also Just so every one know the test cases on CI/CD will try to run you E-Z steps 3500 to 4000 times. REPLY: Also for test.txt file my code took 115 iterations and I am able to pass the CI/CD test. REPLY: Perfect. Thank you both!! Going to give a shot at passing the CI/CD pipeline... hopefully it will pass.. and then I can start cleaning up my spaghetti code. 
THREAD: I'd suggest removing the tabs and newlines.  That very likely is the reason for the difference in term counts.  The newlines should be removed as well.  But they probably aren't throwing off your results.  Treating '\tseattle' and 'seattle' differently is probably changing things. REPLY: Right after removing \t now am getting count of 6 instead of 8, thanks much 
THREAD: Are you doing any sort of processsing?  The doc and topic sizes should be the same for everyone (barring some weird stuff creating dynamic tests).  But all of us could be doing pre-processing that might change the number of terms per document.  I'm doing nothing other than splitting on whitespace. REPLY: I am doing same as you mentioned splitting on whitespace. 8 is basically a vocab size. I am also removing \n in last  in each line REPLY: For eg here: ['grasslands', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'grasslands', 'grasslands', 'waterfall', 'tiger', 'lion', 'lion', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'tiger', 'boats', 'grasslands', 'lion', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'lion', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'lion', 'lion', 'screwdriver', 'tiger', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'toy', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'river', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'tiger', 'lion', 'lion', 'lion', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'fish', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'tiger', '\n'] REPLY: you see \n in last, so I am removing this as well and then adding it an self.documents array 
THREAD: I see almost the same thing.  But my first test case has 6 words, not 8. REPLY: Are you able to pass all tests? 
THREAD: Also, would like to know the use of self.likelihoods in likelihood function as I don;t see it getting used anywhere? REPLY: you don't use it anywhere, you only append to it `def calculate_likelihood` REPLY: so once you calculate the value, store it in there. The unit test in gitlab likely uses this to tell if your code is good or not 
THREAD: is the PLSA function supposed to return something? Or if not, what is the gitlab unit test checking? REPLY: No, The pipeline tests will use the Corpus class to instantiate objects(one for each test) and then call each object’s PLSA method.  It can check the object’s data member for result. REPLY: makes sense, I see that we are supposed to be building the self.likelihoods list so I see how it will be validated now 
THREAD: ... and yeah.... there is a lot more work to do in this MP than the prior ones... going to be a busy week... yikes REPLY: Agree on both points.  I have a good friend that works for gitlab and about to give him an ear full! lol REPLY: I’d wager it’s not gitlab’s fault, but the set up for this course. Looks like it is self-hosted at the university with insufficient resources  REPLY: Good point.  I think I'm confusing with the original URL that referenced gitlab directly REPLY: <@UARSGQKS7> - The real question is do they have sufficient failure detection for those distributed systems?  :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Clearly not hahaha  REPLY: <@UMBMJ3B9N> I think they have 467 failure detections REPLY: <@UMW0NBSDT> - Perhaps, but those failure detectors are only active monitoring ACK/NAK during homework submission periods. 
THREAD: How long should it take to run on DBLP? There are ~30K terms accross ~10K documents. REPLY: I think I saw someone either here or on Piazza say it took over an hour to run on the DBLP data. I haven’t gotten there myself... 
THREAD: Is there anything in the course on using numpy matrices for things like the E-step function? Fighting the urge to use loops which I'm much more familiar with REPLY: I'm not sure you can do much with e-step. m-step there are shortcuts, but I think a couple transposes are required. I say I think because I haven't tested yet. Just have the likelihood method to implement now. 
THREAD: ah yes, indeed, normalization error REPLY: Thank you! I made the same mistake and this led me to the issue. 
THREAD: for the test.txt file, are we supposed to skip the first 100 rows that are already labeled "0" or "1"? Not sure what the purpose of those labels are in the context of the assignment. REPLY: tl;dr I'm clueless too I imported them, minus the 0 or 1.  But I'm not sure whether that's the right thing to do yet.  Maybe we just use those as a check against our results? REPLY: yes, I also skipped importing 0 and 1 column. I used it to check against my results - corpus.document_topic_prob. REPLY: I just passed all unit tests on my first submission. REPLY: thanks, makes the most sense to me to just strip those as well REPLY: I ignored them completely while writing the code. It is only required if you run the `main` routine. Don't worry about adjusting your code for something that does not matter at all for the pipeline. Create a local file by removing those lines from the text file and use it for your tests rather than generating statements to avoid those lines. I passed the pipeline without running anything locally. REPLY: Yes... those are there to confirm the functionality of your implementation.  Don't skip the rows.  That would defeat the purpose.  Skip that column.  Save those labels somewhere else... another file... another array/list, etc.  Then when your program is working, grab the result of your PLSA run for those first 100 rows.  It should be perfectly matched or perfectly anti-correlated.  You aren't required to do this.  But that's why those labels are there. 
THREAD: Hi Folks, Can someone explain pr point me to resources regarding the Build_corpus()  and Build_vocabulary() section of MP3. Is it as straight forward as just picking words and updating the size of each object as stated in the code comments? Also, what differentiates the words used in the document vs. vocabulary? For instance, the vocabulary section says to choose unique words and gave “the” as an example but “the” is not unique and could be considered a stop word, am I missing something? I am also wondering if we need look through the text data to choose what words to put in the 2 mentioned functions? Thanks! REPLY: I think you asked this on piazza as well. I answered it there REPLY: For those two functions I used the comments in the code to help me figure out what was needed.  My documents function simply loaded in the txt file into a list of lists - with separate word elements inside a document list inside a documentS list.   Unique words actually refers to your vocabulary list and not the corpus.  A word can appear 20 times in the corpus but should only appear once in your vocabulary list.  Basically your vocabulary list should be a unique “set” of words.  Disclaimer:  I’m not much farther along than that and haven’t been able to submit anything yet for testing so this is my interpretation of the guidelines; but it seems to make sense for what will be needed for next steps.   REPLY: Thank you Stephanie! REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0>  did you use nltk to build the corpus and vocabulary or we don’t need to import this library? REPLY: I did not use any library.... just ran a scan through all the documents to build both those structures. REPLY: ^ I did the same.. just used readlines to add each line (i.e. document) 
THREAD: I haven't actually  tried submitting my MP3 to the pipeline yet - not even at a point where that makes sense (and not that I *could* right now even if I wanted to),  but curious whether it provides any checkpoint type messages along the way -- i.e. even basic ones like document count is good, vocabulary size is good etc...   anything to help know you're moving along in the right direction...  ? REPLY: Nope... It'll just tell you if the unit tests passed or not. You're pretty much on your own beyond that. You'll have to put print statements in your code to see what it's doing. REPLY: Thank you..  That’s what i’ve been doing so far.   Was just hoping the unit tests might provide some incremental type logs that would tell if you failed something due to wrong initial docs/ vocabulary definitions or whether it failed later on due to  a larger formula error etc..   I’ll just have to jump in and start submitting.... 
THREAD: I love this slide. Can just imaging trying to explain it to someone and having them say at the end: "So what you're saying  is ...." REPLY: I left 10 pages open at the beginning of my CS410 noteboard where I just add the definition for all of these formula pieces.....  Makes life easy(ier) as I can quickly go b ack to that to decipher these formulas, etc.  Not as bad as it looks once you get used to what all that stuff means, but still makes your head hurt ..... 
THREAD: <@UF4G83FL3> how was CS412? (For those of us considering it this Spring) REPLY: I enjoyed the course. Found it harder and more academic than 410 (so far) but then I was learning Python from scratch as well. The assignments were interesting. Certainly more calculations required on the tests though we were allowed to bring in a cheat sheet. Extremely organized and well run course. CS410 has so far taught me more practical application. I definitely feel like a boss being able to scrape any web page and am now constantly thinking of how to exploit this new skill. I plan to take the data mining capstone next fall so for me both were required. Would be great if NLP made it into spring 2021. #NLP2021 REPLY: <@UF4G83FL3>, you’re hoping to take it next fall? As far as I can see, it’s only offered in Spring &amp; Summer: REPLY: <https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-master-computer-science/online-master-computer-science-data-science> REPLY: Thanks for the update! Looks like I’m taking it in the summer. ;-) REPLY: One other thing about CS412: They do not give you skeleton programs for assignments like in 410. You are given a problem to solve and then you go solve it. Perhaps others could do it in less code, but my decision tree assignment was 360 lines of python (using lists only). There was 7 assignments but no final project. REPLY: I disliked the lectures immensely - they consisted mainly of the slides being read at you. I wound up having to actually go look up some of the papers mentioned as source materials to figure out what was going on. TAs were helpful, and the MPs were pretty good! 
THREAD: Hi, I’m so new to Python.

THREAD: Has anyone else found week 9 (week 10 coursera) significantly more complicated than previous weeks?  I can't tell if it's me, the formulas, or the instructions.  Debating on if I need to fit office hours into my schedule this week - thanks. REPLY: I haven't gotten there yet, so TBD... :flushed: REPLY: I just started my week 8 this week… REPLY: So, you are way ahead. REPLY: Yo, will get back to you in a week :grin: REPLY: I think we're "supposed to be" in week 10 (Coursera), right?  PLSA etc..?   I'm pretty sure I'm not ahead, unless I missed a whole section :wink:  If so, yes. I'm only on the first lecture and already having to rewind and replay sections several times over.  It doesn't help that the slides end up with text all over the place as he's explaining things... I don't know which formula goes with what :wink: REPLY: Oh yes probably. I'm definitely behind! :see_no_evil: REPLY: I'd be putting it off, but I heard that it's helpful to have a background on PLSA for MP3.... REPLY: MP3, the audio format? (that's how much behind I am) REPLY: I feel  Week10(on Coursera) is bit complicated compare to previous weeks. I am also doing rewind and replay several times to understand the formulas. Moreover PLSA algorithm is explained in week10 that is related to MP3. If you are coming from data science background it might be easy for them. That is why some of them already completed MP3. REPLY: I don’t know how we are expected to turn in mp3 by Nov 10 given that PLSA is apparently discussed in week 10 (on Coursera) which is due the same week as mp3 REPLY: Given that we are on Week 10 of Coursera, it seems like we have very little time for MP3. REPLY: looks like we need to understand the topics covered in Week10 before we can attempt MP3 REPLY: I thought I've been going week-for-week and I'm on week 8/9 content today REPLY: Week 9 Coursera already has office-hours recordings attached from Oct 22-27, so I was assuming that this week's office hours would cover week 10 Coursera. REPLY: According my calendar, we started  the Week 10 (Week 11 Coursera) yesterday. And yes, I did found last week’s material takes longer time to digest. REPLY: yeah I was waiting unti lI finished midterm to do any more weeks.... will be hitting this stuff hard this week / next.  Actually working on CS425 HW3 this week first, then MP3 for 410.  ugh REPLY: I'm definitely finding it more difficult as well. I thought I caught back up after taking some time to focus on studying for the exam, but I feel like this material will take longer to absorb... REPLY: Thanks all for the heads up. I'm also just now finishing up week 8. Having read this, I'll prioritize getting caught up. REPLY: It's definitely the most complex part of this course... it took me forever to  just wrap my head around stuff, I still don't get all the details. I'll require significant review, that's for sure. REPLY: yea agreed i just reach this point and i need to rewatch the video a few times to grasp the concept 
THREAD: <@UFCCTMXGV> NOTE -  You can go back to your quizzes and see your last results.  You can also continue to retake them REPLY: I don’t think that’s possible.

THREAD: Ah man, that was a walk in the park compared to the CS 425 exam REPLY: totally! CS425 was being told to swim the English channel with your hands tied behind your back. REPLY: Hmm.. I still don't feel better about this exam, but now I'm really afraid of 425... REPLY: I preferred the CS425 exam to this one.  *NOT* because it was easier, but simply having a handful of multiple choice questions is kinda annoying since you have no room for partial or exam questions to recover from any dumb mistakes.  I missed a couple due to brain failures and there was a question I knew I didn't know which was on there.  (of course it would be)  Did fine on this, but I'd just rather have questions where you can explain thought process and work through problems as opposed to a low number of multiple choice all/nothing type questions. 
THREAD: The practice quizzes are very similar. You could just go back and review or re-take them. I studied by going through the study guide and paying extra attention to the underlined sections as suggested (good idea). If it tells you to know something, then know it. I went back and re-watched a couple of sections because I couldn't quite make out the meaning from my notes. In particular I benefited from going back and watching week 4 concerning language models. In doing this I realized I didn't fully understand the equations and what they meant the first time through. This also prompted me to go back and better understand how the formula for BM25 is derived which helped me understand some of the results in MP2-Part4. k1 is related to term frequency for instance. Those that scored high on the faculty set may find that interesting. I did not find the test as challenging as CS412. REPLY: totally agree Alan. I wish we could go back and do the competition again, because i learned so much more when really studying the material for the test. 
THREAD: Whoever is still planning for Exam1 - it is pretty straightforward. don’t overthink over the solutions  REPLY: thanks.  Taking tomorrow.  if that's true it would be better than some of the quizzes REPLY: I found it straight forward too. Made a silly mistake in one question. REPLY: Does reviewing past practice quiz can get me a 70%? I just find the videos are too long and was wondering how much benefit of watching all of it... 
THREAD: ^ I have to say that reading the book is very useful after watching videos, etc.,....  I find there is so much more detail in the book (not really a surprise....) that helps to fill in some gaps from the lectures, especially AFTER you spent some time trying to think through the lecture / assignment / etc. REPLY: Which book? REPLY: The suggested textbook for the course... Almost all the content is identical but reading at slowly paragraph by paragraph and staring at each eq for some time helps... REPLY: I have been reading each chapter after watching the videos every week. Plus the excercise questions at the end of the chapter are more challenging than the quizzes i felt. Clears up hidden misunderstandings REPLY: I honestly am preferring the book over the lectures tbh and reference it first over lecture materials REPLY: I may have to give this another try.. I gave up since the book was basically a clone of the lectures (or vice versa) - even down to some of the ambiguous  wording. I was looking for different real world examples than in the lectures; but, for the most part they were exactly the same with the same diagrams to illustrate them etc...  It does help being able to 'read' something though to reinforce what you heard at 2x speed :wink: . I do think it will be good reference once the class is over for looking up things I've forgotten. REPLY: Thanks! What is the name of the book? It’s good to keep reference. 
THREAD: I'd like to amend my previous statement as "...rewatch all the lectures at 2x speed, until I get that a-ha moment, and redo the practice quizzes" lol REPLY: yeah, i can’t wait until Elon Musk gets NeuralLink working! multi-threaded brain downloads. 
THREAD: i had to focus on the videos for last 3 days… because a lot of material in the video were asked. REPLY: I had watched all the lectures again, but more in terms of understanding the quizzes. I would have changed my focus had I known. Still very salty about it 
THREAD: Any suggestions? REPLY: study everything more than just the practice quizzes 
THREAD: i did not do as well as I would have thought REPLY: yeah, very easy to get caught up in the wording.  but, i wouldn’t worry too much. Looks like we have a few chances to get extra credit. REPLY: that pisses me off REPLY: i don't feel it was an accurate reflection of the overall course REPLY: Same here.. I studied SO much.... and knew the formulas as presented in the lectures pretty well I thought.  I was super disappointed.  Some questions felt like they were trick questions..and i fell for it I guess..  REPLY: Only in academia smh REPLY: Same.  I watched all the videos at least twice, took copious notes, got 100% on all quizzes, retook the practice quizzes, and read the study guide, but I bombed the test (55%).  It was so broad, and with just 20 questions you don't have much room for error.  Good luck to those yet to take it!! REPLY: signed up for tomorrow, we'll see how it goes.

REPLY: Me too, you also have to give their application access to control your computer (you can remove this afterwards) 
THREAD: they change all sorts of systems settings to make your computer unsecure, and then disabled things i use like screen shotting, etc… so i had to figure out how to bring them all back, since they don’t reverse what they do. REPLY: Upgrading to Catalina reset all my app permissions so I needed to give them permissions again. You can turn them back on by going to settings. I usually just search “screenshots” and it should direct you to the right place.   If you don’t ask them to do it at the end of the session, they will almost always forget. I used to create a separate login just for taking the tests so I don’t have to bother remembering to set it back later.  REPLY: That's a good idea

THREAD: Now that MP2 is done, Has anyone started MP3? Its looks like whole another beast! REPLY: Starting this tomorrow.... after I finish off the midterm. Still need to find time for the project :-)  REPLY: trying to watch the week 9 lectures first 
THREAD: Wouldn't you typically have a small subset of training data? REPLY: i didn’t get it.. maybe i misunderstood the purpose of this exercise… aren’t we suppose to have a large training set and test on a masked set REPLY: No sorry, I was speaking in general terms. I thought in most cases you would at least have a small subset of the real data to train on and the rest would be masked for testing.  For this assignment we have the large cranfield but nothing from the other two. 
THREAD: For the purposes of this exercise, masked. REPLY: that works, but we will only have a biased training dataset. would be great if we could have sampled training data from the other two datasets 
THREAD: exam time, wish me luck REPLY: good luck Nick! REPLY: how was it Nick? Questions mostly from Quizzes ? REPLY: I can't really speak to specifics, but I believe they've stated the quizzes are a good thing to study 
THREAD: how do people have submissions in the hundreds and thousands? Does that imply making hundreds or thousands of individual commits? Maybe a script that keeps pushing code up? REPLY: The highest # of submissions I see is 240 REPLY: I'm seeing 323 and 1923 near the bottom of the list REPLY: also a 738 near the 50s REPLY: It is amazing how it adds up even with manual changes. I didn't get serious until yesterday and I'm over 100....  Think I'm calling it good while there's still some weekend left... 
THREAD: You can beat baseline with bm25 REPLY: On leader board check rank 18 "allie" it's without BM25... It's not mandatory to use BM25 only .... 
THREAD: Hey folks, I am having difficulty with MP2-part4. Do we have to also modify search_eval.py for the BM25 method for cranfield  data or just need to modify the config.toml with the chosen ranker method and then run the program? Also I am using atom text editor to do my assignment and I am not able to see the outputs when I run the program. Do I have first pull, commit to gitlab to be able to see the output? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks! REPLY: You only need to modify the search_eval.py file, specifically the "def load_ranker()" function. When the code is run for the competition it uses its own config.toml files, so you can make changes there if you want to play around when you run it locally but it will have no effect for the competition REPLY: In order to get your output on the leaderboard, assuming you followed all the steps in the PDF from the readme to set the aliases, you just need to commit your code and a job will automatically kick off that should finish within 2 mins or so (unless things are running behind). If you wanted to run your code locally, you could, but we only have the cranfield data set, everything else is basically a secret. From whatever directory your files are stored in you would run `python search_eval.py config.toml` from the command line and it should output the score from the cranfield data set REPLY: Thank you so much Kyle! This was very helpful. Regarding the command line, I have tried running on the Mac terminal with python2.0 but it gave me an error that it’s couldn’t parse the config.toml.  I changed the directory to python3 and that’s says there is no such file. I saw on piazza that there is some compatibility issues with python 3.7. Can you give me an example of how to run the python search_eval.py config.toml on Mac terminal or just on python terminal?  REPLY: I'm running mine from within my IDE.  I just adjusted the script so it automatically uses the config.toml file and doesn't require me to run it from command line (too lazy to work with two windows...) . #### UNCOMMENT FOR SUBMISSION     # if len(sys.argv) != 2:     #     print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))     #     sys.exit(1)      # *** COMMENT OUT OR REMOVE FOR SUBMISSION     if len(sys.argv) !=2:        cfg = 'config.toml'     else:        cfg = sys.argv[1]      # UNCOMMENT FOR SUBMISSION     #cfg = sys.argv[1] 
THREAD: Just make sure you’re not polishing a plastic diamond. ;-) REPLY: also as of now, i don’t have what it takes to take you down. so nice work! REPLY: Sleep on it. The idea will come to you in the morning. :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: <@UM5B71WMA> I did not check to make sure im hitting all eight core I just assumed it would. I am now looking into this GIL effect for a work aroundif possible. I'm thinking about re-writting it in c if I have time. REPLY: Np. Only reason i ask, is because i’ve been trying to get multi-threading working in python for years. It never works fast, and multiprocess hangs.. I heard folks were working on a fix, so just curious.  But like you said c/c++ you see all the cores activate, and i love seeing like 1600% CPU utilization in ‘top’ vs python maxes at 100%. 
THREAD: but after the assignment due date is over, i’ll share the entire k1, b, k3 mapping space. where i picked 3 values for k3, incremented b by .1 and k by .05..  have a dictionary of every result that  scraped from the leaderboard. REPLY: AFAIK k3 is the term weighting parameter for the query vector. Setting it to a high value (like the default of 500) makes it redundant for all practical purposes since the queries are so small in cranfield. I tried brute force too but I hard coded k3 making my possible value space much smaller. REPLY: What values did you try for k3? 
THREAD: I'm wondering if the person currently at the top of the leaderboard is using 3 different sets of parameters based on the dataset being tested. I'm not sure if this is in the spirit of the competition or not, but their scores for each of the datasets seems highly optimized. REPLY: I would challenge you to find a way to achieve a score on the cranfield set that matches the top score on that set. If you can't do it, then perhaps you need to re-look at all of your assumptions. There's plenty to learn in this assignment if you want to dig deeper. 
THREAD: it like a guessing game to me. REPLY: Seems like to find needle in dark room.... 
THREAD: And, people will try hard…. the pipeline got this error. REPLY: doesn't matter I think, because I see ranks are getting updated REPLY: Yes.  but it is out of spaces for their backup cache.zip REPLY: Don’t know why they need to zip up the result or something. 
THREAD: I got kicked out of 50 positions and how many students we have in the class? REPLY: Registration page has over 300 REPLY: wow… so you are telling me my rank still have rooms to sink :see_no_evil: 
THREAD: Check the alias configuration REPLY: what exactly is it? REPLY: @595 REPLY: Copying from Piazza : I would strongly suggest you double check that you have added the variable COMPETITION_ALIAS to your CI/CD settings per the instructions.  Doubly check the spelling of said variable.  I saw at least 3 people last night/yesterday having this issue and it was the variable spelling each and every time.     If the variable is missing / misspelled, your results get to submitted as Anonymous REPLY: ok thanks, I will look into it 
THREAD: i don’t see any info from the instructors REPLY: They posted a study guide here:  <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=392>. Other than that I think they just posted that it is 20 multiple choice questions and 1 hr in length.  Deadline is 10/26 or 10/27 -  there was some debate about which date was correct on Piazza...  REPLY: thanks Stephanie! i was searching midterm. REPLY: Yeah I need to schedule that test.... was so consumed with CS425, that I didn't even want to think about bothering with this one. 
THREAD: Any tips for showing your score on the leaderboard. I am able to pass the ci/cd pipeline? REPLY: It should automatically update.  Did you set up the COMPETITION_ALIAS ? REPLY: ya this is what i have REPLY: How come your build is working without GIT_LAB_TOKEN ? REPLY: I just took it off because it was not showing on the leaderboard. But I have added it again and it is still not showing on the leaderboard. I have also updated the screenshot. REPLY: You misspelled COMPETITION_ALIAS REPLY: If you have that wrong, your score gets submitted as Anonymous .... 
THREAD: This message was deleted. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=590> REPLY: ~I'm not seeing my results show in the scoreboard either, but maybe it just takes a little while?~ Forgot to include the COMPETITION_ALIAS variable for the pipeline... REPLY: I got the storage error too, but doesn't seem to affect the results. REPLY: Do you see your result showing up on the score board? I cannot get mine to show up REPLY: Yes, it is there. Maybe follow the instructions from MP1 again from scratch to be sure. Also note that your commit must show as a green check mark in GitLab for it to post to the leaderboard. You can see submission times on the leader board to know if others are able to post. 
THREAD: The whitepapers clearly state that properly tuning BM25 is complicated *and* is very dataset dependent.  This is why the exercise is challenging.  We have 3 different datasets, two of shich, we cannot even see. REPLY: I agree and its very time consuming since you have to wait for the score REPLY: Which value did you loop, k only? 
THREAD: <@UANL30ZDK> Agree. I'm taking Numerical Analysis (450) as well and that's more stress for sure...   This class is pretty balanced, but sometimes that means it gets pushed aside for the other ..  I should have only taken one class, but I'm not getting any younger.. REPLY: off topic , do you find Numerical analysis to be useful ? REPLY: Yes..and no. There are definitely some underlying concepts - i.e. vectors, SVD, optimization etc that will be helpful in later classes.  I'm enjoying the class, but my math background isn't recent and it feels like there is a lot more 'glossing' over of things than I would have hoped.  It's a ton of work for me (possibly not as much for others).  I'm definitely enjoying the  programming assignments.. the midterm not so much :wink:  The TAs/instructors are pretty responsive and helpful on Piazza. 
THREAD: OK so if you were just testing any results on the leaderboard while the baseline was messed up, it affected all results that were processed. I just re-ran the same ranker now that I did 15 minutes ago and the scores are wildly different REPLY: are you getting better scores or worse? REPLY: better, before everything was around .27ish 
THREAD: In a real life situation, wouldn't we have some access then to the actual dataset to train?  With a subset of the same dataset held out for testing?  It does seem like it's just throwing things out there to see what happens.  I basically looped through to find an optimal score for Cranfield, then backed it off a bit since that seemed to be what the leaders had done.. and that brought up my score a little on the other two datasets -- and I hit baseline.  I'll probably make a few more attempts and read up on other techniques when I have time, but I'm not sure this is time effective. I hate to 'settle' for ordinary, but could use the time for the project and midterm :wink: REPLY: That’s my mindset as well. I tried, to but I’m not going anywhere. So goal is to just optimize above baseline. 
THREAD: Builds fail now &gt; Got 56 queries, expected 54 &gt; <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=584> REPLY: This is only happening for me when I try to use a custom ranker instead of one of the metapy rankers 
THREAD: by the way who is @yululiu2? REPLY: I tried to beat that score, but its very time consuming REPLY: My ranking keep sinking.. REPLY: I will have #1, oh yes, I will have #1.......  muhaha muhaha muhahahahahahah 
THREAD: ^ yes, you will have problems if you over optimize on cranfield.  My highest cranfield scores resulted in not meeting benchmark. REPLY: yikes, thanks for the info 
THREAD: since the pipeline is broken and I'm unable to check my scores across all the datasets from MP2.4, can anyone say if overfitting is a serious concern or not for this task? Is it worth my time trying to optimize on the cranfield set alone or is that just a waste of my time? REPLY: i wish they would have just given the data sets locally. REPLY: pretty annoying we can’t check this box off.

Our grading formula for the competition is  5-(Rank-1)/10, where Rank is the position of the student.” REPLY: You get full credit as long as you beat the baseline score....   ranking beyond that is extra credit.

THREAD: For MP2 Part3, are you finding all (most) of your query results relevant? I think all of the docs are for mine. REPLY: Yes, same here.

THREAD: I agree, but they should improve on deadlines and keep Coursera up-to-date. I spent more time trying to figure out what is due than actually doing it. Especially independent tasks like project, tech review, exam, etc. REPLY: follow Piazza post @449 <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=449> REPLY: Thanks for the info, Sayan! What I meant was, they should be clear about all the dates beforehand and everything on Coursera must be updated. As a full-time working professional, I don't have time to read every Piazza post since the instructors already flooded Piazza with the extra credit decision. All it did was making lots of unnecessary posts and it became difficult to catch few notes provided by instructors. REPLY: <@UEPRPCF8Q> Agree, I think they should create one main page kind of dashboard to display all upcoming deadlines and quiz/exam results etc REPLY: For other courses i used Coursera Grades page for the same - i think they should update that page with these additional tasks/projects REPLY: Piazza is a forum. And forums AFAIK are for ad-hoc discussions not for declaring source of truth. Especially if that info is frequently changing ... Am I right or am I right ...

REPLY: Whatever i try is less than the one i get with the BM25 ranker (default ranker in the file). Anybody got a better score? REPLY: nDFG value range is between 0 and 1. Value closer to 1 is better per my understanding REPLY: i know how to read the score, and I am not getting scores above 0.5 so I am wondering if I am grossly off or if everyone else is in the same ball park. REPLY: <@ULJEHGP7V> I got better results with some tweaking of the BM25 parameters, but none of the other functions or even the customer defined function did better. REPLY: I second that the only thing I changed is load_ranker function and by changing different parameters I got better result 
THREAD: correct REPLY: Thank you <@UANL30ZDK> , could you share your experience ? How close the exam was with the quizzes ? If the content that was shared in the PDF by faculty enough for preparation ?

THREAD: Hi, can someone please clarify the late policy for submitting MP assignment? I check the syllabus and states that no late work will be accepted but I am getting conflicting statements from piazza post. REPLY: *Course Policy and Grading - CS410 Text Information Systems* (Not sure if it's same for Fall 2019 as well)   Late submission of an assignment would result in a reduced grade for the assignment, unless an extension has been granted by the instructor. *An assignment is worth at most 90% credit for the next 24 hours* after the deadline. *It is worth at most 75% credit for the following 24 hours*. *It is worth 50% credit after that, but within two weeks of the deadline.* Unless in exceptional cases, assignments will generally not be accepted if they are two weeks later after the due date, which means that if your assignment is turned in 14 days later than the due date, it would not be graded and you would receive zero credit for the assignment. If you need an extension, please ask for it by sending email to the instructor as soon as the need for it is known.  *source* <https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs410/sp2017/>

REPLY: Yup I got this as well. REPLY: my understanding: if you pass pipeline, you implementation is correct.  The pipeline should invoke your implementation of inL2. I got the same as yours. REPLY: that is not correct REPLY: if you look at the pipeline output it is doing a "similar" comparison; therefore, there is some expected variance.  Because of that, your formulas could be wrong, but yet you still pass CI/CD. REPLY: " $ python /data/cs410/mp2/mp2_part2_unit_test.py /data/cs410/mp2/mp2_part2_unit_test.py:48: DeprecationWarning: Please use assertEqual instead.   self.assertEquals(*is_close*, True) " REPLY: What they should have done with this assignment is tell was what the MAP should be for a given value of "c".  That would allow you to know that your formulas is right. REPLY: additionally, if the "c" value did not lead to the optimal MAP value, there would be zero impact in disclosing that REPLY: For example if they said... with a c of ".01", your Mean Average Precision would be 0.18434, then you could validate your formula.  Further, since 0.18434 isn't the optimal MAP, it wouldn't cause any harm to disclose that REPLY: agree. Thanks for clarifying. REPLY: Yeah, it's not ideal. REPLY: I will say that my implementation also performed worse than BM25 but passed the pipeline REPLY: NOTE _ I raised this to instructors to see if they find it acceptable to post a sample "c" / MAP value to help people validate their formulas.....   (e.g. sample above :slightly_smiling_face:  ) REPLY: I have to do CS425 now....  :male_zombie: REPLY: Will we be graded based on what we put in our significance.txt? My search_eval.py passed the test in the pipeline but I didn’t know if I had to keep tweaking with my c parameter and what the p value had to be in the end? REPLY: I don't think the value matters as long as we provide the file itself with a value in it. My understanding is that part 4 will be concerned with the actual optimization, this part was just to get us to implement the algorithm. 
THREAD: So with the above, you can develop in your windows environment from vs code and connect remotely to the linux environment without ever having to leave your windows environment. You can install extensions for both environments as well. REPLY: That's pretty cool, I'll use that from now on. Thanks Derek! 
THREAD: What are people finding is the best overall development environment for this class? Currently I use WSL-Ubuntu and Windows, but I have to keep going between the two (and transferring files repeatedly) because neither seems to do well as a dev environment by itself.  (Editing in WSL isn't awesome, since all we have are command-line editors like Nano and no Jupyter Notebooks--plus we can't copy into the bash command line--but on the other hand, a lot of things seem designed to be done in Linux) REPLY: still on W7 here, so no WSL for me - VMWare Player + Ubuntu is working ok so far. I installed PyCharm in the VM and mounted the directory with all the cloned repos for this course 
THREAD: In regards to 'R', anyone using R for Windows to do this?   My linux image wouldn't cooperate when I tried to install R REPLY: I used R Studio in Windows, and didn't have any issues. I'm going between WSL and Windows (and copying files as needed from WSL bash), since neither environment seems to be able to stand on its own as a dev environment. Quite frustrating--hopefully someday I'll have time to set up a better env. 
THREAD: Funny you asked about iCard, mine literally showed up today REPLY: Same actually, just went to check the mail again and there it was! 
THREAD: Assignment Question (no, nothing confidential) - Do we need to do anything with the following results?  "Choose one of the above retrieval functions and one of its parameters (don’t choose BM25 + k3, it’s not interesting). For example, you could choose Dirichlet Prior and mu.  Change the ranker to your method and parameters. In the example, it is set to bm25. **Use at least 10 different values** for the parameter you chose; try to choose the values such that you can find a maximum MAP."  It seems like this is just for us to experiment and see how the paramter change impacts the results.  We are not required to save / upload these results? REPLY: Yeah I saw a piazza post where one of the TA's said that part is just exploratory. REPLY: Not what I was expecting, either haha REPLY: yeah, some of the assignment guidance is a bit vague, but usually they are quick to answer or clarify. REPLY: I think this part is important for part 4 where you have to create IR system REPLY: so exploring what works and doesn't work will help with that 
THREAD: i was sooo full of myself going into part 2.. i was like this is going to take 30 minutes and i can move on to the next item… 4 hours of trying to make this stupid thing work with python 3.7.. i gave up..

REPLY: finally figured it out after reading through Piazza REPLY: <@UANL30ZDK>: Can you pls share the link in pizza post to understand this better and complete it? REPLY: <@UM5B71WMA> yes. I spent 15 hours on it at least and still never got it to pass. I pinged the instructors on piazza but received no response REPLY: the instructions are terrible REPLY: i think the deadline is over now. REPLY: I mostly just wanted to see what I did wrong. I knew it was something stupid. I accepted I missed the deadline, just wanted to figure it out. Thanks James for sharing the post with the formula. Somehow I missed that. I was missing a set of () and it all passed after that *sigh* 
THREAD: How come we can see the answers we chose on the Coursera practice quizzes, but we can't see the answers we chose on the real Coursera quizzes, only the result? I am trying to review for the exam. REPLY: As far as I know, you can not view those options unless you take those quizzes again. The best strategy is to print the webpage before you submit your quiz. Then you can print again to see which ones you got right. This seems like to much work, but it pays off during exam preparation... Otherwise you don't see options for true false or multiple selection questions

REPLY: i’m getting an error REPLY: To add files you use -  *git add &lt;file_name&gt;* *git commit -m “&lt;commit_message&gt;”* and finally  *git push* to push changes to remote repo REPLY: What’s in error message? REPLY: it worked when i pushed to my own fork REPLY: is that okay for grading?

I think TA mentioned to push changes into fork only but we can confirm .... REPLY: i just sent a note REPLY: i’ll find out what they say and let you know. Thank again. REPLY: Your welcome <@UM5B71WMA>  REPLY: You can even use github desktop app and point to the gitlab repo if you want to avoid the cli  
THREAD: passed and p-value under 0.05 yay! :grin: REPLY: May I know how many values do you have in text files? REPLY: I saw entry from piazza that P-value should be higher than 0.05.   A small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis.  If I understand correctly, null pypothesis: no difference between two systems.  So now you get value smaller than 0.05, so you reject the null hypothesis. That means that two systems are different. One must be better than the other.  Can someone  tell me if my understanding is correct? REPLY: P-value will differ depending on which parameters you used for your rankers REPLY: see <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=285> for more discussion 
THREAD: on part 2 I'm guessing I should be getting higher MAP for InL2 than BM25? or no? I don't know if I am interpreting this correctly REPLY: As far as I know, BM25 is the best one out there. It's tough to better it with simple known theories I may be completely wrong though.

THREAD: How much content is needed for MP2? different schools have different faculty count. is there any limitation? REPLY: You can extract whatever you can, my understanding is that bio_urls should have all profile urls if available but content page May differ which you can extract based on common html structure in most of the pages 
THREAD: The university and department which I am scraping, none of the faculties have their own website or homepage other than the one listed in the department. Is it ok for MP2 part 1 or should I look for different university/department which has “more information” or “faculty website” content ? REPLY: I ended up switching from my undergrad alma mater to a different school because of that so I could get a sizeable amount of content REPLY: It should be ok if you don't have individual home page for faculty members REPLY: My school has a dept listing page and from there each faculty member (most) have a link to a page that includes their name, contact info, education, biography etc... but that link is within the schools' domain and not a "personal" website or link to their related research group.  So, I'm still getting a distinct URL that I have to get to and scrape from the main directory... but I don't have as many levels of links as some people seem to.  I posted about it on Piazza and most other students (that responded) seemed to think it was ok as long as there is enough data to use for future assignments etc.. REPLY: thanks everyone..

I'm thinking I'm fine leaving the number in scientific notation but not sure. REPLY: I don’t know if the unit test checked the value in significance.txt file or not. But, I put the `p-value` with scientific notation. 
THREAD: Has anyone been able to work on the metapy assignment on a mac? I'm getting stuck as people reported on piazza post 255 (`ranker.score(idx, query, num_results)` hangs), and have been trying to figure out why for an hour without any luck. REPLY: Hey Allie, I had a the same issue too. Are you using python 3.7? It seems to hang in that version. It worked for me when I switched to Python 2 REPLY: Yeah, I am using 3.7, but I saw somewhere in the metapy docs that python 3.x should be supported. I'm trying the EWS route for now... hadn't used it before so didn't have it set up, it seems like kind of a pain, but I started to worry that writing something using Python 2 on a mac might not be compatible with the TA's evaluating it on EWS REPLY: I got EWS set up now though, so guess I'll just stick with that :shrug::skin-tone-2: I thought it must have been some set up thing, like some config got installed in python 2 instead of python 3, but I couldn't find any stack overflow questions to help me, haha :see_no_evil: REPLY: Haha same! There was barely any info on stack overflow. My group mate ran into a similar issue and told me to try out Python 2. I haven't gotten EWS set up, so I might check that out as well REPLY: Apparently Python 3.6.x works as well REPLY: So weird. EWS is definitely NOT very smooth, but at least I know that it'll match what they're using for grading :confused: REPLY: Ok I was able to get it to run on my mac. I had to install 3.6 as above and create a new build system in sublime to use 3.6 REPLY: i also had to install metapy in 3.6 as well, but it ran nicely REPLY: Same... I created a new "cs410" env (Conda) and installed python 3.6.9 and metapy/pytoml.  The script didn't hang this time; but I'm a little afraid to see what else I might have messed up.  :wink: I'm new to using virtual env, but I might be a fan. We'll see.. REPLY: Oh yeah, I see on the MP2 FAQ post on Piazza that Siwei confirmed MeTApy is not compatible with Python 3.7. For some reason I just could not believe that could be possible and it must be some other problem, haha. I feel better now :joy:

I looked into all threads on piazza and cross checked my implementation - I don't see any issues with my implementation. Any suggestions for debugging? CI/CD error message isn't helpful. REPLY: 1. Whether you produce the correct *.txt file, and format it to the requirement (simply list of number) REPLY: 2. whether your search_eval.py runs successfully on the grader (sometimes importing stuff like scipy make the code fails) REPLY: Thanks Ian. I figured it out. I was not setting c = some_param. Changing that solved the issue.

REPLY: you are getting text from the html element div and grab that text and concat with ‘\n’ (line separator) REPLY: you can use developer tool in chrome browser while opening the website and explor what is the div element REPLY: The separator = ' ' maintains the space in between words. I.e. if you were pulling text that had a tag in there ("&lt;p&gt;This is line one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;) you might get back "This is line one.This is a new paragraph" once the tags are stripped out.  The separator would maintain space(s) between the two paragraphs.

THREAD: just out of curiosity...what were the topics if anyone knew abt it, were chosen for prev term project proposals? REPLY: topic of a technology review or project proposals? Week5 has topic for technology review. But for project proposals we have to wait. you can find more info <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=113> REPLY: I’d like to know this as well.  It would be helpful to have some general understanding of the scope of the projects and types of methods and tools used so we have some time to consider what projects *might* fit into the guidelines and also be interesting and relevant - vs having to make a quick decision between when the details are released and when our proposal is due (is it week 4?)

THREAD: I am confused in "Sort by term-id", are we sorting by  terms at individual document level i.e terms in doc1 will be sorted by term-id within it? Per my understanding this is what should be happening here but I don't see it in this slide because for eg: doc1 id is 1 then why doc1 partition in 2 phase ("Sort by term-id") has 2,4 doc id listed in it? REPLY: The 2nd phase is done on whatever tuples the memory has at that time.  So the collection of  tuples in memory at that time contains the tuple &lt;2,4,3&gt; from document #4 on item #2.  The drawing in the middle is not about partitions corresponding to doc 1, doc 2, .. etc.  This is my understanding. Please correct me if I am wrong. REPLY: that should be sort by term-id in the each individual doc  (e.g, doc1, doc2, doc3… ) so that it’s easier to sort by term id globally ). Ignore those doc id 4 in the middle. It’s just example .

THREAD: Anyone disagree with some of the answers from Quiz 1 (Week 2)?  I'm looking over a couple and am thinking the auto grader may have made an error? REPLY: I felt they were ok. Could you mention the questions specifically? REPLY: Questions 2 and 6.  "Text Engines rely on the text push method" and 6  "The number of outcomes for document ranking and selection are the same".  on 6, I am not sure if I am getting hung up on the definition of "outcome".  Seems like n documents and n outcomes. REPLY: For Q 6 I was making the same mistake but i believe they want to know "All possible out come" which is different then N Document N out come REPLY: for Q6 the number of outcomes for document ranking and selection might not be the same even for a single search. If you search once then ranking will list all documents in decreasing order of relevance. So, for N docs you will always have N results. However, selection will only output the docs it thinks are relevant and ignore the rest. Hence, in this case the number of results you see will be anything between 0 and N. REPLY: and yes the meaning of "outcome" was a little confusing. It is as <@ULYT71VA7> mentioned above. They wanted all possible distinct search outcomes. Imagine you were allowed to search infinite number of times with different input each time. What is the total number of possible distinct search result configurations is what they wanted. REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0> <@ULYT71VA7>  Thank you a bunch for that one.  That outcomes makes no sense to me whatsoever.  In determining relevance, I would have one number, then insert it into a  sorted list, not then compare it to all the others each time.  WHO WOULD DO THAT?????

THREAD: For MP1, we don’t require to use EWS machine right? Since I can run those python codes locally. I only need to finish and submit `example.py` file for my grade by pushing it up to my repo and get passed unit tests thru Gitlab pipelines, right? REPLY: Great! REPLY: I never logged in to EWS until the end of course. All my local macbook pro... REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> do we need to use EWS Machine on any assignments? REPLY: Or course project? REPLY: I believe that was provided for students who doesn’t have a environment for running MetaPy or unix environment... I used mac for all the assignments back in 2018. Cs410 was my first class in this program.  REPLY: Another related question, if not using EWS, but using local windows environment, what terminal can be used for MP?  I tried cygwin and git bash, but I have a lot of issues on installing metapy and pytoml. REPLY: I don’t know.. but if I only have windows machine and dont’ want EWS.. I’d probably running docker on my windows machine and work on it? REPLY: most of assignment for CS410 don’t require IDE level assistance, so any environment should be okay I guess. REPLY: I did MP1 with WSL of Ubuntu 18.04. You can install it from the Windows Store for free. REPLY: There's a Remote - WSL plugin for VS Code that worked really well for me. REPLY: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl> REPLY: On the WSL Ubuntu 18.04 all I needed to do to get my python environment going with python 3 was to execute the following: ``` sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python python-pip sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 20 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 10 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip2 20 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip3 10 sudo update-alternatives --config python sudo update-alternatives --config pip ``` Select the corresponding number for pip3 and python 3 on those last two commands. Then you just use python and pip commands on the system for python3/pip3. REPLY: For GitLab git SSH, I had to generate a RSA SSH key as per this document: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/>  TLDR; ``` ssh-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ``` Then copy the key on the screen and add it to your GitLab SSH Keys under GitLab settings. REPLY: Oh one last thing and I'll shut up. If you use WSL, DO NOT do the "pip install --upgrade pip" command as suggested in the MP instructions. When you do the apt update and apt upgrade, pip is already up-to-date. REPLY: Thank you all for good info. REPLY: I have not been able to get this working - something about unexpected '(' REPLY: gonna see about EWS REPLY: At what point did you get the error? REPLY: Maybe you were trying to execute all the lines in that block above at once rather than one line at a time :thinking_face: REPLY: I don't remember exactly, but I am able to clone/push via ssh 
THREAD: is anyone able to run the "wget -nc <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt>" command on pycharm terminal? REPLY: Are you running pycharm on Linux, Mac or Windows? If you're on Windows, I'm pretty sure it won't work. Just put the URL in your browser to download it then copy it to your working directory. REPLY: Looking at your Piazza post the problem is that you're trying to execute a Linux program, wget, from a python terminal. wget is a Linux command so it is only valid from a Linux terminal (probably a Mac OS terminal too) but not a python terminal. REPLY: <@UJ2HVPHDJ> As mentioned <@UM062HP1V> you can use browser to open *lemur-stopwords.txt* file and copy paste in your local folder with same file name or you can use *Curl* command if using MacBook. On window you can install Git Bash to use Curl command.... REPLY: thank you for the response.. I used wget.download() command and it worked

REPLY: What was the question and I can explain? REPLY: Well the question was like you said if we replace the weights with frequency of word instead of just binary 1,0 then will the rank of the list change or not was the question. REPLY: Yes that's what I initially thought that we need to consider frequency of words appearing in document but that's not the case. If you take a close look at the example in videos, for the one having multiple campaign( I think it's doc4) even for that just 1 is considered to calculate weight

However, they indicate that they're for last year (Fall 2018) so probably something that the professor still needs to update. Maybe, Monday? REPLY: i can't access as well REPLY: Yeah, guess we have to wait...

REPLY: <@UJBH1GGKW> how to check piazza forum, can you please share link ..... REPLY: If you have a Piazza account you just add the course by semester and course name on Piazza. I just signed into Piazza, added classes, selected fall 2019, and entered CS 410. The class showed up in autocomplete.

THREAD: Btw, I paid for CCA Coursera public class last night and finished up to week2 including quiz, let’s see if I can finish at least CCA part I on Coursera before the semester start so that I can only focus on AML for a while… Coursera said that subscriber can cancel it in two weeks and get full refund but wondering what happens if I just keep going without cancelling. For CS410 they’ve just cancelled my $49 and refund it back automatically iirc and something messed up on their side.. ended up not charging me $149 since I’ve already finished up to week3 or 4 back then. This should be interesting “find-a-bug” for me. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I finished the Part 1 for CCA and got a certificate. I hope the quizzes transfer over. If you are only trying to get ahead on the lectures you can download all of them (I did this so I could watch them while travelling) then drop the course (I did not do this). I assume if you are over charged by coursera you just contact their help desk with a clear explanation of what transpired and they make it right. I currently feel like I was undercharged last semester and still need to reach out to them about this. REPLY: the quizzes should transfer.  You might have to request the transfer though - it is not automatic. REPLY: I remember CS410 and CS425 quiz progress was automatically transferred when semester has started. Automatically means I didn’t ask or request to mcs-ds or mcs-support. REPLY: let’s see how it works lol REPLY: I had to ask on CS410 and it did not happen until about a week and a half into the semester. REPLY: That said, I am not too worried about it. For things like this I imagine it will just work out and I am more interested in focusing on the learning than the administration. 
THREAD: Response on Piazza from TA says that the grades will be posted on Coursera over the next few days.  REPLY: can you please share the post# as I couldn't find it? REPLY: I made it private to instructors, so that it didn't appear to be a complaint  
THREAD: Here's how you get to your Coursera grade list: If you are on the course page that shows the week-by-week listings in the left-hand frame, the Coursera logo is in the top, left-hand corner. To its right, there is a small arrow in a circle. Click on that and select "Switch to all my courses." In the menu on the left, there's an item labeled "Accomplishments."

THREAD: what is “Quality Points” mentioned along with the grades and GPA ?  REPLY: Add the quality points and divide by credit hours to get the GPA. I'm not sure why they made it so complicated. REPLY: It's like that so the final GPA can be derived. A 3 credit hour class would count less toward your overall GPA. I've never seen it called quality points, but that's the purpose. REPLY: Where do you see "Quality Points"? I can only see grade letters on StudentInfo page. REPLY: On <https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/> under "Registration &amp; Records" &gt; "Final Grades" REPLY: It has something called "Academic Standing", do you know what that is ?

THREAD: Feeling a little nervous as tomorrow I thought was the date that grades were due and I don’t see anything updated yet.  REPLY: Awful lot to grade in a short time with Christmas holidays in the middle. REPLY: Absolutely but we are only a day away.  I’ll settle for an A-   No need to put too much effort in to get the + ;)  REPLY: I'm anxious as well - would be satisfied with A- REPLY: I don't think grades will be released until Saturday, but I can't waiting any longer! REPLY: Email says 2pm tomorrow REPLY: That would be nice. Of course, I'm not convinced that the date instructors are required to have grades submitted is necessarily the same as when we are allowed to see them. REPLY: It would have really helped in bringing peace if they would have released the project grades  REPLY: C- is what I need for company reimbursement, and B- is what uiuc requires for graduating grading. That said, as long as it’s B- or higher I’ll be happy. :) can’t expect A+ due to messed up midterm exam... :( REPLY: Result out? 
THREAD: Doing it together REPLY: I did that my first semester last year REPLY: It is busy, but I found it doable REPLY: CCA is not much work with the exception of a group project REPLY: AML is quite busy - 10 reasonably complex programming assignments REPLY: You can do it if you don't mind buckling down and forgoing some free time. REPLY: I have a full time job and a toddler btw, so if you have more free time than that, you should be good REPLY: what’ group project in CCA was bugging you? REPLY: <@U8GELQ7KN> I understand that the final project is open-ended, so is the course set up so that you can choose the project early in the semester? REPLY: that's true.  You can also work in groups REPLY: Although you won't necessarily know what cloud technologies to use unless you read ahead or already know.  They are pretty lenient on the grading though, I found. REPLY: Is there a MOOC for AML? REPLY: No but the lecture videos (and link to textbook PDF) are here: <http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/courses/AML-18-Fall/aml-home.html> REPLY: ok great!

REPLY: Yeah, given that I’m working full time and 2 young kids, the only time available to me for the exam is 10PM to 2AM lol REPLY: Same with me ... and thats why I wont choose CS425 :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: The content was really good though. REPLY: funny thing is when it was getting closer to end with 2 sections left to answer, I asked proctor on how long do I have left. The answer was I don’t know, just let me when you are finished. Perhaps he was bored as well and wanted to leave :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: 3.5 hrs is too long for them too :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: I've heard the workload for 412 is higher than 410 although I'm hoping that some of the concepts carry over so we're not starting from scratch. What I don't have any sense for yet is what AML will be like. REPLY: I would say generally they are similar (lectures,  weekly quizzes, 3 exams, 3 MPs). The project/tech review in 410 was a lot more work, but it was also interesting to try to implement something right away from the lectures. The MPs in 412 are require more programming, but are more informative, in my opinion. 412 drills into some of the algorithms more, but requires less math.

Now I think I took it too seriously as my company’s production level and should just put everything one image lol REPLY: still it’s wonderful how those 3~4 python file requires 1GB size of docker image for “run everywhere” stuff lol REPLY: every single pip command pulls zillon of dependency into local

How is it created?  I assume it's a generator.  If you have iterated through that generator before, you can't iterate it again... you need to re-generate the generator... but without the actual code, I'm just guessing here.

THREAD: I have a repo on GitHub for the project work. REPLY: And the video is separate? REPLY: I should probably just dig through the instructions in the prev weeks. REPLY: I'm not sure about that.

REPLY: we’ve got a gitlab project right now ( just to be different? :slightly_smiling_face: ) REPLY: Video isn’t mandatory isn’t it? REPLY: I actually don't know. I'm trying to find where the official project retirements are now. I remember the wiki with the topic suggestions mentioned that last term had more things required--including a video. Not sure what we need... REPLY: Hmm. Actually it looks like a video may be required, although it sounds like a 5-10 minute voiced PowerPoint would be sufficient. I'm having a hard time making sense of all the things we need to do! REPLY: Do we really need a video or voiced PowerPoint? I thought a comprehensive readme will be sufficient? REPLY: Which is why I spent lots of time on updating readme lately. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jky3wzh9mon231?cid=915> REPLY: <@UAQQMLM3J> That answer sounds like, yes, we need a video but it doesn't have to be PowerPoint if it satisfies the objectives. By the way, it sounds like the README could be a significant portion of the project documentation score so that effort wasn't wasted, but the presentation is a separate task. Like I said, this all seems so confusing to figure out! REPLY: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/rdPbB/course-project-overview> - It looks like it’s 20% of the project grade. REPLY: okay seems like I need video… probably I’ll be end up just making a few slides of PPT and add my voice in it, and record it lol REPLY: Yeah, I don't think the video needs to be too in depth. And with less than a week left to put it together I hope that's right. REPLY: Or simply just show my README.md on video should be enough? lol REPLY: I think so. As long as you have voice...

They have taken my issue into consideration and may help me to reschedule a exam session during working hours(Monday-Friday). I think the proctor want to help me to reschedule however as the day was the last day for the exam(they could not select the reschedule date from the dashboard) so they are not able to help me to reschedule directly. They said they would contact our organization(CS410 TAs).  I have asked the TAs to help me extend the exam session so I could pay for the exam2(if needed) and reschedule the exam by myself. :fearful: Next time I would choose an earlier exam session.... :cry: REPLY: It should work out.   I can't imagine they would risk the whole semester efforts of a student because of a small technical issue. REPLY: I faced a similar issue during Exam1 and they rescheduled it and waived off the fee as well. REPLY: Hope it works out and good luck!! It seems that a lot of people have tech issues with proctorU, and I think there should be better guidelines from the university on how to resolve them. (eg. in your situation should you have just paid for a test that day and worked on a refund later?) 
THREAD: ...it is kind of troubling that the system can be so delicate REPLY: exactly...haha... 
THREAD: I could not take the test, please teach me how to reschedule and how to get the refund I have just had a test session at this morning, but due to unknown issue(technical issue: My video freeze every time I connect to the proctor U), the Proctor handover the task to another operator and the operator told me my session ended that I could not take the test.  I started the test on time at 09:40am Singapore time zone which is the time I scheduled. But experienced a technical issue and transfer between the Proctor operator for about 40 minutes. Then they told me my session ended.... :disappointed:  I could not get the refund and could not reschedule the exam.......  Could the TA help me to reschedule the exam as I could not select it from the Proctor even though I want to pay for it again ;(  Or if anyone has the suggestion regarding this issue? REPLY: You can email to Ismini, she will be able to help you for sure. 
THREAD: do we maintain access to the old lecture videos and whatnot when we finish the course? REPLY: I took 410 last year…and just verified the lectures are there (and viewable) from within Coursera… 
THREAD: the only real issues I've had are that A) my webcam apparently sucks and can't zoom, and B) they take 20 mins to get me started on the test REPLY: oh dear, you mean OSU like greasy bucktoothed rodent mascot OSU?  :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: (joking) - I live in Corvallis, got my undergrad in Eugene :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I try to anticipate the late starts by showing up early, but when things didn’t work this time it took me 30 minutes to get a human support agent, and by that time my scheduled session had disappeared from their web interface.  Granted, it’s a final and I’m just gonna be a little high strung for these things … REPLY: how do you like corvallis? REPLY: my little brother just moved there REPLY: it’s a pretty charming town, I’ve lived here 17 of the last 20 years.  housing market has gotten pretty inflated, but the engineering and cs departments have spun off lots of companies with good opportunities for developers over the last couple decades REPLY: HP has an office there right? REPLY: yeah, I’ve worked there in the past.  currently work for a company that resides in a building on the HP campus REPLY: Yep always close to 20 minutes to start. And I finished this exam in about 15 minutes... REPLY: yay, HP. I work in HP, but never been to Corvallis office REPLY: I worked on webpress software there a few years back 
THREAD: Proctoru and sucks have a syntagmatic relationship for damn sure REPLY: Forgive my frustration venting ... They left me hanging for about 40 minutes.  Every other test has gone smoothly. I think I'm going to just set that notebook aside and use it only for test taking now REPLY: I have a macbook which is pretty much used to surf the web and take proctorU.  The first time I went thru 2 windows laptops before I found the macbook that would work REPLY: I've had a smooth experience with them so far. But, at the end I'm left with the feeling that I'm still being watched. I go through my process list to make sure nothing remains ... still the feeling persists. Think about it.. after the session 'ends' how do you know it has actually ended. Maybe I'm being paranoid :thinking_face:.. but after writing a few Trojans myself, just being lax during the dev phase is enough to let a rogue developer in... and nobody will have a clue. In fact I use a separate cheap windows laptop to take the exam and for almost nothing else. Bit extreme maybe... :face_with_raised_eyebrow:. Sorry, just had to get this out. 
THREAD: Done with the final exam. Surprised by the difficulty level (way too easy compared to first term exam) but happy at the same time for the perfect score! REPLY: Nice!

THREAD: I just nominated Ismini for the TA awards. For me it seems she really stands out from the crowd. In some other subjects some TAs have been somewhere between invisible and disappointing (to put it politely!), but Ismini seems to work really hard at making this course work for us. If you agree…. <https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/8663423> REPLY: Agree, she deserves it REPLY: I nominated her as well. It was an easy decision as not only is she very helpful but she is very PRESENT. I cannot emphasize that last part enough, she was a near daily presence and that makes all the difference. I can only hope I have an Ismini level TA in future classes, it's seriously a game changer. So far this CS 410 class is the gold standard of my MCSDS experience. CCA was ran ok but content was a little weak. Stat 420 had great content but holy crap it was horribly ran. Like beyond abysmal. It literally had me contemplating applying to a different school because what's the point of paying $2400 to teach it all to myself?! However the CS410 content and excellent support from Ismini has restored some faith! REPLY: hah, I also applied to other universities based on the appallingly amateur experience with AML and CCA in Spring 2018. Got accepted and was about to leave, but the first few weeks of the summer courses were better run (Stat420 started well but became a disaster as you say), and winter has actually been really good, so in the end am glad I stayed. The TAs in my first subject AML were truly awful (with the highly notable exception of the “Amazing Eric”), they even went on strike for a week or so for more money, but no one particularly noticed as they weren’t really supporting students anyway.  Ismini is a world away from those jokers… as is/was Eric. So I think they really deserve some acknowledgement. REPLY: Totally agree. Had no question in my mind when I saw that nomination email. REPLY: +1, I submitted the form as well. Great TAs are really hard to find so I am happy to heap praise on the ones that want to do a great job. REPLY: +1, I also submitted the form. When I saw the email I just had to nominate her right away. REPLY: :heavy_plus_sign::+1:

THREAD: I was reading prof Zhai’s PDF and then suddenly jumped into CCA public course part I to see how is the class… REPLY: Is it that easy? REPLY: Well what CCA covers are what I have been doing at work for years... are you talking about Prof Zhai’s PDF? 
THREAD: Is there an overlap of topics between CS 410 and CS412 - intro to data mining ?  REPLY: definitely.  Cranfield evaluation (TP, FP, etc) , distance measurements, entropy, etc. all that is in common. Both very useful, none redundant, but yeah overlap. 
THREAD: I was same as <@UAK4LU685> and scheduled parents visiting in the US -&gt; makes me to drop CS425 :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: You had better sense to drop when you had time.. I tried to be extra brave :stuck_out_tongue: Hasn’t been a smooth ride, but no regrets! 
THREAD: <@UC4SHGAHM> CS425 is considered as one of the best course in this program. But it is challenging in terms of time and efforts. I averaged per week 30+ hours on CS425. Adding 410 + full time job + kids at home =&gt; turned out to be a marathon that I want ended soon! But if you have enough time, I would recommend this course. REPLY: How does one even do that and maintain their sanity?! CS425 on it's own sounds awful! REPLY: It’s definitely stressful. I also fell ill untimely. Ended up taking a week off from work to catch up. Not planning to repeat this feat next semester :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I imagine your health thanks you for that decision! REPLY: To only a certain extent; work as well tend to accumulate backlog to catch up on upon joining back. 
THREAD: <@UC4SHGAHM> I ran away from it but at least up to week 4 wasn’t difficult, it’s just… those weird ambiguous quiz and stuff to do bothers many students. That’s what I heard but in general prof Indi’s material seems good. REPLY: I thought the first 4 weeks were the hardest, I had a lot of trouble with the first homework assignment and first MP.  But the other homeworks and second MP have been a lot easier. REPLY: Good to know. At least now I know what’s CS425 is going to be in general. :smile: 
THREAD: How was CS425? Was it tough? REPLY: CS425 is a great class; it'll give you plenty of challenge and knowledge.  If you plan on taking it, I would recommend brushing up on Probability/Counting Theory (maybe some differential equations, not necessary though), and BOTH C and C++ programming.  The syllabus and MP instructions say the code is C++, but the style used is more akin to C than C++.  If you've not had an equivalent course to UIUC's CS 241, then I would also recommend reading through the CS 241 course website's materials: <http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/wikibook/home.html>.  That course is an explicit prerequisite and is all in C. REPLY: Thank you 
THREAD: Btw for my CS410 final exam this Saturday… If someone give me a empty paper and ask to write down a stuff I’ve learned.. I don’t know if I can fill it out. I’m in trouble… REPLY: Study the quizzes and you'll be fine. 
THREAD: AML  + CCA is in my bucket but I’m pretty sure I need to drop one of them for work-life-study balance lol REPLY: Ping me if you're about to drop AML. I haven't been able to register for it. 
THREAD: <@UC47VMDAB> I have been asking the same question for some time now and mostly the answer is it depends on your background in Math and Computer Science. But one useful metric is AML demands a lot of hours which if you add any other course will make it difficult to manage. After experiencing 425+410 this current semester, I have decided to take only AML in spring semester. REPLY: Thanks this is helpful. I feel AML is vey critical course of entire program. But the way things are setup if i don’t take 2 of them it will push the times lines to 2 years or more. At some point will have to push harder and take 2 courses  REPLY: AML is a hard requirement and probably a core in this program. So I guess we should give it a dedicated semester :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks for the inputs. I am going for doing AML+CCA+DM But after your input I will keep AML+CCA REPLY: No worries!

That's either bad or very bad. REPLY: <@UC0AYN258> To be fair they said they would email everyone when a decision has been made so perhaps they're just leaving it at that and ignoring the continued queries. Frustrating for us though REPLY: Yeah.  Probably.  Keep hoping for  a good outcome! REPLY: Me too man, me too. I am expecting to have to spend the bulk of my xmas vacation preparing for AML, I would be extremely frustrated to spend my time that way only to have the class not take!

THREAD: How did the exams go for those who have taken it so far ?  REPLY: It was good. I would say little easier than Exam 1, ofcourse IMHO. REPLY: We’ll see. Mine comes this Saturday 11AM lol REPLY: Oh okay. So nervous about this!  REPLY: I thought both exams were very fair. REPLY: it was very easy. aced it within 20 mins (Not bragging, just answering:). Almost no math. I spent so much time understanding the math of logistic regression and modeling priors in LDA... definitely useful and good to know but certainly not the core of the exam. REPLY: Phew DONE. I was in a panic too because I could not remember any math from any of the videos. REPLY: TL;DR; it depends on how you are well prepared lol. Seems like prof’s PDF is helpful  + less math formula than exam1 though. REPLY: I didn't make use of anything extra... just went thru most of the videos again @ 2X speed. REPLY: so it ends up okay to you? :smile: REPLY: :) yes I believe that helped and anything slower would up me to sleep. :grinning:

THREAD: Is MP3 already over? The implementation I ended up with was pretty close to the tutorial. I tried a ton of other solutions but none of them worked any better. Now I think I should try something a little more unique just to be safe. REPLY: I wouldn’t worry too much.  I had a similar concern.  I asked the TAs.  They’re not grading the MP3 assignment with the same rigor/criteria as the other MPs, since they know we are occupied with the final project and midterm.  The spirit of the assignment was just to experiment. So as long as you’re above the baseline you’ll get full credit. Btw was the business travel for AWS re:invent?   REPLY: This was just Thanksgiving holiday with the family. I haven't been to re:invent yet but it looks like it would be an interesting event to check out sometime. REPLY: I honestly don't know why anyone would do anything above the minimum on mp3. Time spent studying seems much wiser.  The bonus is tiny -pretty likely irrelevant if you understand things well enough to do well in quizzes and exam-  and if you want to play with metapy classifiers why not do it locally with data you know? going through the minutes-long feedback loop throwing different combinations without really understanding the data (or what the LDA variations do) seems like a massive waste of time. REPLY: Agree. The MPs could have been great learning experiences but the implementation feel short. 
THREAD: I compared/contrasted 3 BM25 research papers(fun stuff and one step closer to a parameterless BM25 function).... hehe REPLY: Cool. I really should take a look at some of the research behind BM25. Were the papers reasonably understandable? REPLY: Yup, amazingly so!

THREAD: Just to confirm, if I see my name appear above the baseline in the leader board I'm good? I feel uneasy because I only changed one line and I feel like it can't possibly be that easy  REPLY: Correct. it is the same thing as MP1 and MP2.

THREAD: all this randomly generating words from a language model reminds me that given enough time, a monkey can produce Shakespear :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: More than just Shakespeare. Given an infinite amount of time a monkey can produce all books and novels ever produced by humankind. REPLY: There’s not much difference in monkey producing Shakespeare with monkey producing all books in the universe from a human perspective.  :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Ha, just started reading that wikipedia article and it actually states that there: "In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times." REPLY: Yeah, given infinity everything is possible REPLY: Kevin, I think there is a difference between those two statements though REPLY: Kevin, correction: given infinity everything _finite_ is possible REPLY: However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero). REPLY: So.. basically even though it is mathematically possible universe will probably die before this would have occurred.

THREAD: You can make 1 particular change to the file and pass.  Will you learn anything. Probably not, but it does get you full points REPLY: I have made many changes ans still struggling. Tried to learn metapy tool and its representation :disappointed: . You meant change the classification algo? REPLY: Yep. The instructions even say just change the make_classifier function  "You will want to change the code in the make_classifier() function in the file classify.py to use a different classifier. You might also want to try changing your feature representation by modifying the [[analyzers]] table array in config.toml."

You can run competition.py (just change the config to point to your local config.toml, not /data/cs410/…) REPLY: in competition.py, it directly invokes classifier.classify(…) which does not check for types REPLY: also, if you want to go with this route, `pdb` and `pdbpp` are your friends REPLY: `pip install pdbpp`  &amp;&amp; `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` REPLY: The assignments are borderline pointless but yes you can learn something on your own if you’re motivated and have time to climb the leaderboard  REPLY: bleh, I’ve already wasted enough time on this ridiculous exercise in pointlessness … I just want to hit baseline and get to work on anything else. REPLY: For the new class is it required to implement all the mandatory methods and variables? REPLY: No, only the one actually got called REPLY: has anyone gotten that new class to work?  using EWS machines and environment I get nothing but that C++ error still. REPLY: Did you try directly call `classifier.classify`?  instead of using cross_validate.  My take is that `cross_validate` is a C++ function which only takes the C++ classifier type. REPLY: I didn’t, good call though, I’ll dig into it REPLY: So call make_classifier.classify(dset)?

THREAD: Man googling meta toolkit sucks REPLY: haha, give it up :slightly_smiling_face:  even if the term "meta" is more google-friendly, it has close to no useful documentation.  I ended up cloning meta-toolkit C++ source code and just rummaging through the code. REPLY: Yeah I did...heck I wasn't even trying to research for MP3, I was just curious what are some known alternatives and even that was pointless. REPLY: I found a way to use scikit-learn to do this assignment (even though I didn't use it in the end).  They said you can't modify .gitlab-ci.yml to install other dependencies, which is fine, but they didn't say you can't in your classifier module to shell out `pip install scikit-learn` and other modules :wink: REPLY: I've never used scikit-learn, it is similar? REPLY: It's one of the best machine learning packages out there.  It can also do text classification and has much much better community support and documentation. REPLY: I have heard of it but don't know anything about it. I'm completely new to all of this (machine learning, nlp, python, R, etc), a whole new ecosystem to me. REPLY: I'm new to ML and data science in general too.  This course has been eye-opening especially the first half.  The second half feels a bit too dry and abstract and difficult for me to make much practical connection.  MP3 provided _some_ of that practicality. REPLY: Well that's encouraging, I'm about to start it! REPLY: MP3 is easy to pass baseline, but tough to understand some of the metapy functions.  There is basically no documentation on metapy, and the function names are different than C++ meta 
THREAD: I really wish the MP showed some of the clustering results. Just showing a number going up or down doesn't really show me what it is doing. My frustration with the second half of the course is that it explained why things were hard but we never get the chance to see what that means in practice. REPLY: You can download the files and run locally to get more info. REPLY: Ugh. That sounds like work! But I think it would be a good idea to get my hands dirty with some actual clustering/classification tasks to really understand the material. REPLY: I feel same. Some better real world example would help digest better. 
THREAD: For those of you who have done MP3, how time consuming is it? REPLY: Well I spent a lot of time going through both the c++ and python libraries searching for parameters, parameter strings, and what not until I compared them all... hehe REPLY: What is a lot of time? Hours? Days? REPLY: Maybe 1 or 2 hours the first try at it and another 1 or 2 hours last night until I hit a magic sweet spot. REPLY: Oh ok cool, you had me worried for a moment. I was hoping I can bang it out in a night. REPLY: Defintely doable. I had like 8 lines of commented code where I kept track of the scores relative to baseline... The best line at the beginning of starting the assignment ended up being my best line to pass the baseline, but with a few minor adjustments... REPLY: Took me several tries but not that much time - 2h total I'd say. REPLY: I'm just happy to hear it's measured in hours, not days. REPLY: I think I only spent 15 minutes or so of actual work and maybe an hour waiting for pipelines to finish. I *might* spend some more time over Thanksgiving trying to change features and use other algorithms but then again I will probably just leave it as is. REPLY: no therein lies madness REPLY: The 425 MP took me more like 15 hours to get through a very basic implementation, so if you want something a little more challenging... :-) REPLY: <@UC1389H28> 425 sounds like a beatdown but man I bet you learn a ton. Unfortunately I wasted my my cloud breadth requirement on CCA. REPLY: Yeah I put like 4 hours into the 425 MP2 so far, and put some quick(lame because that's where my seg fault is) ring implementation in place so I could work on other parts. I am hoping only another 4 or so more hours to implement the ring and stabalization protocol... MP1 was about 18 hours(2-3 sittings) of work/reading through all the cpp and .h files! REPLY: I felt I spent more time on CS425 MP1, mostly due to fighting with C++ and the weird way MP1 uses C++ (like, use pointer arithmetic to deref a field in a struct, really?) REPLY: Most of my time on MP2 was also spent fighting C++ but we had fewer arguments this time around :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Same here too! I was like just let me get the node id and i'll be good for the rest of the project(5 hours later).... REPLY: Almost like me using an array instead of an unsigned int to hold bit values during my undergraduate studies... hehe REPLY: At least we don't have to debug for memory leaks... lol REPLY: If I had a dime everytime my program segfaults... :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I still have all the lectures and quizzes since mid-terms to finish up in 425, but I am done with 410!

THREAD: w12 - done REPLY: I’m about to put 10 to bed, myself … is the worst behind me? REPLY: Think so. 11-12 better then 9-10 :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: a lot of formulas but no needed for quiz. just general undestanding REPLY: Completed Chapter 9 on maybe Tuesday, 10 this morning(for a second I forgot I watched CH.10 this morning and not 2 days ago), and 11 looks short enough to consume when I wake up at 11pm... lol REPLY: Ditto REPLY: 12 done. REPLY: :+1: 
THREAD: Exactly. For the midterms I did 410 on Tuesday and then 425 on Thursday. It was a rough week. REPLY: ahh, misread your comment above.  Yeah, two midterms in one week was dreadful.  A little bit better this time around, but we do still have 410 course project to finish before 425  final :&lt; 
THREAD: hey all - when is the last date to take the exam 2? is nov 30 or dec 2? REPLY: I could see slots in proctor u only till dec 1 8.40 PM EST

THREAD: I read about it last night... No clue what needs to be done. REPLY: For MP3 as well ? I was hoping MP3 would have better text 
THREAD: Finally finished week 9. Wow, things really were spiralling out of control. Especially the LDA stuff and the "it's too complicated to explain but magic goes here" explanation. REPLY: What’s more frightening is that I got 100% on both week 9 and 10 quiz but I don’t think I understood even half of what he said in the lectures. REPLY: Yeah, I've found the quizzes often don't cover the deeper meaning of the material and tend to focus on some basic ideas. I got a 100% on my second try but a few questions were like "oh, false was wrong so let's try true this time". REPLY: just saying that there are a few tricky one in week 10 quiz REPLY: so stay awake and don’t try at night you’ll be confused REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> Didn't you learn your lesson about taking late night quizzes earlier in the semester? :-) REPLY: That’s what human do right? lol REPLY: Never learn from the mistake. :) REPLY: Yeah it got really wonky there in the end, some of those formulas had about 20 symbols going on. :exploding_head: 
THREAD: <@UAKF444KA> which week’s material you stay in right now? REPLY: week 9 lol... really behind 
THREAD: O how I miss the simple TF-IDF and BM25 transformations of the pre-midterm lectures... REPLY: I never thought I would agree with such a statement but here we are 
THREAD: as per week-9's practice quiz Q8 -  "the probability of background component weight is learnt not fixed." in the lessons, P(w|thetaB) was always given and p(w|thetaD) was learnt.. can u guys plz mention if I'm missing anything here? REPLY: But p(thetaB) is learned, which I think is what the question is referring to. REPLY: <@UC1389H28> makes sense. but in all the lessons, we took it for granted 
THREAD: Moved to 10. Will came back to 9th later. Hope 9 has little correlation with others weeks REPLY: Moved to 10. Will came back to 9th later. Hope 9 has little correlation with others weeks 
THREAD: in Lesson8.9, does `theta` represent *model param* like lambda(as mentioned L8.7) or *topic*? I'm a bit confused REPLY: In 8.9 there is only a single topic and a single document so theta is the topic distribution.  I guess you could say that this corresponds to a model with parameters lambda = ( {theta}, {1.0} ), a single topic that fully covers the single document. REPLY: Thanks <@UC1389H28> I'm still missing something REPLY: In L8.7 - Prob of observed data vs model param (lambda). Optimizing lambda REPLY: In L8.9 - Prob of observed data vs theta ? Here, theta refers the topic or the model params - lambda ( like pi values and k) ? here, are we trying to find the theta which would optimize observed data? REPLY: In 8.7 there are multiple topics, multiple documents, and multiple topics per document. So you are trying to find the lambda which optimizes all of that. So there may be a text mining topic an a travel topic and one document is 90% text mining and 10% travel, etc. All of that information gets packaged up in lambda. In 8.9 it's a simpler case where there is only one topic and one document and that document is only about that topic. In that case, all you need is the topic they since there's only the one. REPLY: Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates are two different ways to determine what "best" means. With maximum likelihood the topic is exactly the word distribution found in the document. I'm actually having trouble wrapping my head around the Bayesian approach. I understand what it does I just don't know how to apply it. I think it might go something like this: you think it's a text mining document and you already have a text mining distribution but the distribution is different so you come up with kind of a compromise. REPLY: thanks, <@UC1389H28> for sharing this detailed explanation. I think your understanding of the 'Bayesian approach' is correct. in L9.4, it is explained well. 
THREAD: I watched it twice and still not sure I understood completely REPLY: So any tips? I fear given my luck, they will show up in the tests :tired_face: REPLY: My tip is to just go on with your life :party-parrot: REPLY: If you find some good material that supplements that week though.. let us know :stuck_out_tongue: 
THREAD: Week 9... it's like he's started speaking a language I don't even understand. My lack of adequate math background is hurting me here. Lots of reading outside of the course material! REPLY: Yeah, man, it is a drag... Too much theory without actual examples.. REPLY: And btw if you find some interesting article / material on this please share! 
THREAD: just discovered that ipython has a nice integration with pycharm - i find that it feels more natural than a browser, for playing with the mp3 tutorial REPLY: Thats interesting thanks. It used to be rubbish, will give it another try… REPLY: console + vim + python was enough for me although I have full IntelliJ version now lol 
THREAD: confused if I’m taking probability and stat. REPLY: The key is automating all stat diagnostics in a language more suitable for CUDA and equivalent technologies.... 
THREAD: I have not started week 9 yet, but I just finished weeks 8 and 9 of lectures in 425 and doing another one in 425 tomorrow.... hmmmm REPLY: What? You are doing 425 at the same but got bored? :joy: 
THREAD: Week 9 desperately needs some real tangible examples... maybe that's what MP3 is for REPLY: ok I was wrong - MP3 is not about topic analysis at all... 
THREAD: Do we get a coursera certificate as we complete each course in the degree program ?  REPLY: you get a unique web link to verified certificate. You can add it to LinkedIn too. REPLY: Oh okay! Thanks <@UAK4LU685> !  REPLY: Oh I didn’t know that. Are you going to have certificate for those internal UIUC stuff same as public Coursera one? REPLY: For each course you complete through Coursera irrespective of it being part of this program or not will give you verified certificate url. I don’t know whether you’d get it for the ones don’t use coursera like AML. 
THREAD:  REPLY: Not in SoCal. REPLY: those are copied from CabaZon facebook website where it’s located in Desserts Palm Spring. My area isn’t 97 but something like 83 yesterday. REPLY: Ok that was just about Bay Area :)  REPLY: Bay Area especially near San Franciso was pretty cold due to those cold sea water from the north IIRC compare to SoCal. REPLY: East bay is slightly better in that aspect  REPLY: Unfortunately at least in south bay, there doesn't seem to be that much change of color in leaves. The difference is just more leaves vs less leaves... REPLY: True. You have to specially look for to see autumn colors. I specifically miss the drive to office during fall while I was in east coast near Philadelphia.  REPLY: Phoenix here, still getting highs in low 90's unfortunately but the mid 70's at night is nice! REPLY: “Winter is coming” invokes a different emotion in Arizona :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Haha you bet it does!! The next 7 months is what makes it all worth it. REPLY: Lived in Scottsdale up by Pinnacle Peak for 21 years... I don't miss the heat one bit! REPLY: Used to pay for a golf pass at the Scottsdale Country Club that was only 100$ for 100 days of summer! 15$ cart fee there after to play 2 of 3 NINES because its that HOT! Regularly something in the 130 dollars to play on the same greens when the weather is nice. #hawk REPLY: Yeah if you're willing to endure the beat down you can play some world class courses for pennies on the dollar 
THREAD: Did you plan to use it to make a tutorial for your tool? REPLY: I was actually planning to use it to get a list of available coursers on Coursera so I can download the contents from Coursera. Otherwise I will need to crawl the webpages to get the information, which I don't mind, but i think it's kinda stupid considering all the information is already there and is available in one cousera API call :disappointed: REPLY: True  
THREAD: Isn’t Franch/English/German has same root language? REPLY: It's complicated(tm) lol  English and German are both Germanic so they share a lot of grammatical structures, vocabulary and so on.  French is Romance which is a different language subgroup under Indo-European family and is more in common with other Romance languages like Italian and Spanish.  English and French are only in common insofar as they share a lot of common vocabulary b/c history... the English royal family has French roots for many centuries.  It's like Korean and Japanese have a lot of borrowed words from Chinese but grammar-wise they're totally different. REPLY: lol didn't mean to be controversial REPLY: Lol, it is cool. I was just being funny. You clearly are passionate about the subject REPLY: English is Latin-like and French-like thanks to the Battle of Hastings. To this day, Norman French is still used for ceremonial purposes in the UK Parliament, and the monarch grants royal assent by writing "Le Roi le veult" or (with Elizabeth II) "La Reyne le veult," formally translated as "the King (or Queen) wills it" but less formally as "This is what the King (or Queen) wants." REPLY: The funny thing is that American's are hugely influenced by English history, because it's all written in English. For example, in English history, Napoleon is an evil villain. Most American's share this view, even though he was always very good to the US (he ended the Quasi Wars, erected statues of George Washington, held a huge state ceremony on his death, and sold the US Louisiana for a song.) REPLY: wow that’s something I didn’t know. I guess I need take some american history lecture on Khan Academy if there is any lol 
THREAD: week 8 quiz was not due yesterday, right? I think it was sometime in November but I guess they never changed it in coursera REPLY: They did change it in coursera. REPLY: Mine still says October 21st REPLY: weird REPLY: mine was changed long time ago REPLY: <@UAMELDNR4> try logout and login REPLY: you aren’t taking public CS410 right? lol REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y>, oh crap you're right, dude! All this time I was doing public CS410 and didn't notice that I didn't have to pay $2,400 :smile: REPLY: Logged out, logged back in  Deadline October 21, 11:59 PM PDT REPLY: wait… if you were taking public quiz.. you might be in trouble now REPLY: Well, I just won't worry about it I guess REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> , I was joking, sir REPLY: LOL okay REPLY: Humor doesn't convey well over text REPLY: surely you didn’t pay Coursera fee for CS410 right? REPLY: cause I didn’t (i’m not joking lol) REPLY: asked tech support and they said it’s fine. ( I don’t know what that means but okay ) 
THREAD: for leaderboard competition, Can we use bm25 also? REPLY: sure REPLY: thanks <@UC0TZ5D9A> 
THREAD: <@U8LMAB308> yes even if you're on a team, you submit individually - in that case everyone submits the same thing (at least the same final project proposal) REPLY: Thanks :+1: 
THREAD: I'm still working on the documents. do you know the cut off time( CST/PST 12 am today) of submission ? REPLY: Cutoff time is midnight CST (10PM Pacific) 
THREAD: seems like at least my proposal is unique so far. Not sure if it’s good or not though since it indicates no one else is interested in my topic lol REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> what is ur topic? REPLY: It’s about online chat idea that people can use in-game chat, TwitchTv, etc.  
THREAD: I got a 91% plagiarism score on my project proposal--because each team member is supposed to upload identical documents. I'm actually surprised that the detector performed so poorly in this case... REPLY: I got 100%. This is strange. REPLY: I hope instructors will check this later on. 
THREAD: So the 5% extra credit, is it 5% on the assignment or 5% for the class?  REPLY: Should be for the class. I remember how it was described how important such extra credits are, which help to jump a grade from A to A+ etc. I am not sure if the extra credit would be a combined score of both MP2 and MP3 REPLY: <@UAPREGE8M> your score in the leaderboard is amazing. I tried a lot to increase the score by tuning params. No idea how you achieved almost 0.5. REPLY: Thanks for kind words. I agree with you, the leader board competition is not easy. Bag-of-words is a blunt instrument for text retrieval.  REPLY: Hopefully it’s for the class. 5% for the assignment is basically worth nothing when it gets tabulated to the class grade.   
THREAD: So I did have issues with super low MAP scores, but then when I committed them, the autograder thought they were fine, and that was resolved with this Piazza post. I don't know if that's the same issue you're having: <https://piazza.com/class/jky3wzh9mon231?cid=358> REPLY: I’ll take a look. Thanks  REPLY: Yeah that didn't work. I think it's something to do with the C code and possibly WSL.  I thought it worked, but I may have been doing a lot of it on my Mac instead of my windows laptop 
THREAD: I am following the tutorial <https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/tutorials/2-search-and-ir-eval.ipynb>. When I am running the step#9, i get a typeerror: nonetype object is not subscriptable. Any pointers, what I could be doing wrong. REPLY: `content` is `None` which means `idx.metadata(d_id)` does not have a `content` key.  You can add a print statement to print out `idx.metadata(d_id)` 
THREAD: It helps - man data curation seriously even at 1.5 his rate of speech still seems only normal REPLY: Haha, that is so true. I literally listen to half of it at 2x speed. 
THREAD: I interpreted the assignment as basically a test to see who could game the system the best. REPLY: I agree for the most part, but I think as I reached higher, it caused me to start looking into why some of these variables needed different tuning or why they were acting their certain way. I don't think I would have done that by just reading. REPLY: Even the examples that are out there just use OkapiBM25() with nothing else for all their analysis. REPLY: Agreed. Learning to game the system has given me a much better grasp on how the system works. 
THREAD: Now only if I could figure out how <@UC8GU2UBW> got his cranfield so high. REPLY: Haha please stop leaping me :P REPLY: You got me on the cranfield. I can't figure out how you got those results. 
THREAD: The p-value in here: Ttest_relResult(statistic=4.652328732727442, pvalue=5.613721574653927e-06) should be 0.05 correct? or is this represented in percentage? REPLY: Do you get this result by using the InL2 function with implementation of the score(Q,D) equation as given in MP2 ? REPLY: no this is the significance test value.. got this by comparing bm25 and inL2 
THREAD: coding was maybe 5% of the entire time spent REPLY: I have submitted request to google doc to update university link with gmail account. Is that fine? When will we get access to google doc? 
THREAD: At this point I have to say for MP2 that is there anything other than “luck” and “time to spend to try all the possible combination” until you find that specific magic number when we don’t know what’s data set for apnews that takes 70% of the score AND a few student only tried less than 10 times and still in top position in the leaderboard? lol Even if you know what’s the meaning of those special parameters ( lambda, alpha, etc .. you name it )  Now I’m done done with MP2. REPLY: 1 of them is the TA.  The other I'm not sure. They may be just good at this..  There is more than luck, but it took me a little bit to work out what should be done and how to look at everything. I would say there is more than just luck to get higher on the leaderboard. REPLY: I don’t know, there is a few students who tried less than 10 times but still in top 30 REPLY: I can see now how some people get there. But less than 10 is pretty low.  If you followed all the threads here and converted yourself to NDCG, and saw that you needed the mid 30's to be ranked high. You could do it in one time, but the odds of that are low. REPLY: yeah even that… 
THREAD: Wondering anyone has tried to calculate ndcg score on test data REPLY: You can use *ev.ndcg(results, query_start + query_num, top_k) instead of the ev.avg_p function REPLY: shouldn’t that be divided by number of queries? REPLY: Yes but I wasn't going to give the entire thing.  
THREAD: ok thats very helpful. thanks <@U8GELQ7KN> REPLY: My pleasure. 
THREAD: yeah I guess. How much was that? extra 5% or something? REPLY: do you know it is 5% extra to the programming assignment or to the final course grade? REPLY: it says it’s 5 point on Piazza but I don’t know if it’s 5 point worth base on 100% relevant scoring or literally means 5 points. 
THREAD: I think I got it. I am supposed to replace "ranker = load_ranker(cfg)" in the main with my own ranker REPLY: Nope. Just update load_ranker function to return `InL2Ranker()`  There are internal mechenism which would call `InL2Ranker.score_one()` from main function call where program read query's one by one.  Hope this helps 
THREAD: I think I need to clean out load_ranker and just leave "return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) " there? REPLY: Yes you're correct 
THREAD: i wonder what ranker he's using REPLY: I wrote my own. 
THREAD: anyone tried to calculate NDCG on testing data set locally? can share how can we do that? REPLY: Instead of using ev.avg_p use ev.ndcg

THREAD: I'm down to 128 now. People need to stop trying so hard!!! :-) REPLY: there's only 125 people on that board REPLY: I was looking at the leaderboard that included previous students. I should probably find the filtered version that just compares against current students.

THREAD: However if you haven’t used those PasS stuff (either google cloud or AWS ) or even wore, if you mix those stuff for your project, you’ll end up spending more time to learn and figure out how to use those services/libraries than implementing your project. It could have many tricky situations than you have. REPLY: I’ve played around with API a bit already, but I agree they can be tricky. 
THREAD: Can someone please give me a link to the list of topics suggested by the instructor for Tech review... i dont seem to be able to find it.  REPLY: <https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=679056363>

THREAD: Can we use T.TEST function in excel for calculating p-value? - for MP2 REPLY: I'm pretty sure you can use whatever you want REPLY: They aren't going to check. REPLY: Cool thanks.. I am getting an exponential value but definitely way less than 0.05.. I understand the concept of p-value but not sure if such a low number is possible or correct...  REPLY: It is possible. It's actually a good thing REPLY: It should be less REPLY: that means they are significantly different REPLY: Cool thanks guys!! REPLY: I got the text from console to create the files REPLY: file looks like Query 10 average precision: 0.20416666666666666 REPLY: should I  remove the text "Query 10 average precision:" and just leave the number REPLY: What should be the value for tail and type for TTEST in excel? REPLY: <@UC6KF2109> Yeah just place the outputs without any text thats in print statement in two columns of excel (one column InL2 and second column BM25 outputs) and then do a T.TEST with type as 1 (meaning paired because both rankers have same number of values) and tails as 2 ( it made sense for me to use two tailed distribution)..

REPLY: <@UCAF53F2L> So, I went through the document, I'm not sure what it will try to help with. REPLY: maybe MP3? REPLY: It’s a jupyter notebook script. REPLY: It looks like using a model to extract topics and based on the topics to score terms. I think it could be referred to and may have a better score REPLY: I have’t tried, and I don’t think I’d have time to explore using a topic model to implement a ranker, but it think it’s worth trying. REPLY: or I could be totally wrong 
THREAD: In the Statistical significance testing part, we need to save the output in the " bm25.avg_p.txt." file ? REPLY: Is this part optional ?

REPLY: we can write our own script, that was just an example of how to do it in R 
THREAD: I saw my name on leaderboard. it means "passing the baseline on the leaderboard" ? Or, I need to got better ranking ? REPLY: There is a set baseline on the leaderboard. Your rank should be above the baseline for passing. REPLY: There is a specific row in the table, colored green and with the name "Baseline". You need to be ranked above this row REPLY: 298	Baseline	0.3702	-inf	0.3461	-inf	0.3806	-inf	2017-03-02 | 01:03:25	1  is this one ? yes.

THREAD: Just finished the exam.  Didn't get 100% but I'm happy with the score.  The exam was quite fair with 2-3 "trickier" questions.  Now onto cs425 which is more worrisome lol REPLY: All the best :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Good luck! REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: Is MP2 due tomorrow?  REPLY: No. It was posted on Piazza. It's been set for the 21st REPLY: You scared me dude :joy:  REPLY: Thanks! Lol I was scared for a bit as I dint see that post. 
THREAD: of course I was wrong in assuming that! Nevertheless, I’m happy at least I passed REPLY: exactly same feel i got REPLY: Me too ! :grin: 
THREAD: Me too! So nervous :exploding_head: REPLY: don't worry. it's not hard (I studied 1.5 days, missed one q). Just make two or three passes on the questions. IMO that's the one key skill: not submitting to quickly :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: Done with mid term for CS410 now time to prepare for CS425. REPLY: Me too. Frankly i think cs425's will be easier because half of the topics have been beaten to death in homeworks and mps. I think that's the one downside of the really easy mps on cs410. REPLY: I’m still nervous on getting asked something complex with a very limited time on hand. I spent multiple weekends on each HW, no way I can solve those complex questions in 90 mins. Especially on how tedious it is to mark timestamps on process flow and the amount of calculations a problem can have. 
THREAD: Finally done with my exam. Some questions were a bit tricky and I had to take a 2nd look at it to make sure I understood it correctly, but I guess I managed to somehow understand the gist of the question. REPLY: What score did you get? REPLY: (if you don't mind my asking) REPLY: i managed to get 100% :slightly_smiling_face: Guess a bit of luck was on my side too! REPLY: Congrats. I think I psyched myself out of the correct answers for a few questions because I felt like I really knew the material going in. REPLY: Congrats! That's terrific. REPLY: I missed one, but I agree Shrikant, the 2nd and 3rd look are the keys to these tricky multiple-choice exams. REPLY: I recognized a few trick questions but then I started wondering if they were double-trick questions. Multiple choice and true/false questions don't leave any room for subtlety or explaining you're reasoning. 
THREAD: Created poll for the score range REPLY: That has overlapping values for the 10 marks -- since the exam had 20 questions, there's a strong likelihood that a lot of people got 70, 80, and 90%. Can you remake it with one that has exact boundaries? REPLY: I can not edit poll :( 
THREAD: Done with exam finally REPLY: how’d it go. guna take mine soon, nervous but tired… REPLY: It was ok...could have been better....dont worry it will be fine REPLY: thanks :blush: REPLY: I’m taking it in 2 hours. Now am not feeling good about the above comments from Aditya! REPLY: <@UAKLSUM4M> don't worry i think you'll be ok.. i guess i just underestimated it a bit.. make sure to brush up on concepts rather than specific problems.. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks! I hope it goes well. REPLY: It wasn't that bad IMO 
THREAD: wow.. that exam sucked.. i feel that the quizzes absolutely don't represent the depth of knowledge required in some topics to give that exam.. REPLY: I agree. I studied a lot learned the concepts very well.  I develop test for a living. In my opinion, I don't think this was a good measure of my grasp of the concepts. I did not do very well on the test. On the bright side, I know the material very well now. Onward to putting energy into getting point via other methods. 
THREAD: it's the floor of log base 2, you dont need to remember the whole log table REPLY: yeah, that won’t be too much to remember if the question has low value of x.. something within 10 
THREAD: are we suppose to remember log table for gamma code questions? I see calculator is not allowed. REPLY: log base 2 with floor can be calculated easily . using powers of 2. REPLY: for 2 its 2^1 so 1 for 3 its 2^1 so still 1 for 4 its 2^2 so 2 for 5 2^2 its 2 similarly you can calculate REPLY: thanks! REPLY: all the best for the exam :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: Thanks for the info on which classes are difficult! Very informative. REPLY: I want which courses are more useful over others.. or maybe which materials are more prepared well for online course than others lol REPLY: Stat 420 was suppose to be really good.. Last semester wasn’t so good.  REPLY: CS425 is suppose to be really good.  REPLY: DataViz was pretty interesting and pretty organized and smooth.  CCA is outdated. Stat420 like I said is suppose to be good. Just wasn’t this past semester REPLY: I found STAT420 to be really good from the content perspective but really horrible from execution perspective (at least Summer 2018). Maybe I am an outlier but I found DataViz ridiculously easy and not that useful. :face_with_rolling_eyes: REPLY: For me it was my first class, and I never used Tableau before.  So it was good to see other methods of visualizing data.. I think that is one area where probably lots of people need help..  REPLY: Stat 420 was a shit show in Summer 2018, apparently it was really good before that. Hopefully that was an outlier and not the new norm. REPLY: I didn’t find the dataviz lecture content that great but I loved learning d3 and really enjoyed the final project  REPLY: Other than R Studio stuff, I've done zero data visualization, I assume someone like myself would learn a lot in DataViz ? REPLY: Yes though depends on how much you put into the assignment  REPLY: Yeah, JTinAZ: I've done 0 data visualization as well but I can tell you it took me maybe 8 hours to do a midterm project. But final was a bit rougher with learning d3 and all. The problem is we didn't really get much content, no one taught us d3. We were taught some basic fundamentals and then you're on your own roaming around internet trying to understand how it all works. REPLY: Whereas STAT420 lectures were super informative. But as you said it was a shit show otherwise. REPLY: For me data cleaning was the easiest (and least useful), and AML (poorly run) and ABM (well run) the hardest by a margin. stat 420 wasn’t that hard but poorly run (last time) and high workload. CCA was reasonably easy but shallow  (and also run poorly). PSL is easier than expected (so far) but still not that easy, and well run considering it’s the first time. Text info sys is mid range difficult and effort (and well run so far ) REPLY: I had so much expectation for AML and a bit sad that it ran poorly… REPLY: Thanks for the info on which classes are difficult! Very informative. REPLY: grahamc2, you think STAT420 was easier than Text Info Sys? That definitely tells me how different people are :grin: REPLY: It all depends on people’s background I guess lol REPLY: I took Data Viz over the summer. Loved it. With Text Info Systems, the lectures are very good, but they keep having technical problems and most of the major deadlines have been moved, which makes it difficult  to keep track of what's due when. Also, the extra credit for participating in the Piazza forum is frustrating. It basically rewards people for doing the lectures early. If you do them (say) midweek, then almost all of the questions are already answered for that week's lectures. REPLY: I am taking CS 498 Applied Machine Learning in the Spring. Sounds like I'm in for a lot of hard work and disappointment. REPLY: Some people said AML is good but it’s poorly executed. Also for extra credit, we don’t know who’s gonna take that credit. I’ve answered many question by myself but only one or two are marked as “good question” by instructor. So I’d rather spend those time for focusing more in materials or for mid/final term than extra score that you don’t even know what’s the current status of me lol

THREAD: You need 75 for the course to count in the core 4 courses.  B or better.

THREAD: “Sub linear transformation is needed to capture the intuition of ‘diminishing return’ from higher TF.” Can anyone please help me understand what that means ?  REPLY: Sub linear transformations e.g. logarithm =&gt; if you take the derivative of ln(x) for example (not sure we use the natural logarithm tho!) =&gt; the derivative is 1/x. This means for a small change in x, ln(x) changes by 1/x, which is decreasing as x increases. Therefore, we have diminishing impact as x increases.

THREAD: it's binary with an added number of some value to the end of it right? REPLY: 9  1 + floor(log(x)) =  1 + 3  = 4 unary prefix  1110  x - 2^floor(log(x)) = 9 - 8 = 1  in floor(log(x)) = 3 bits  001  so gamma coding: 1110001 REPLY: for quick gamma, i found it useful to check from floor(log2(2)) to floor(log2(8)): it’ll boil down to 1,2,3. REPLY: than the transformation in unary of the value + 1 REPLY: then you’ll add the rest until you reach the soil of the next log...

THREAD: Are you guys bothering with memorizing the formulas for the exam? REPLY: I’m not. Focusing more on the content as there are plenty of libraries that do all the formulas for us.  I think the basic understanding of how the functions work and why they are different is where I’m spending most of my time.  REPLY: I'm not but I am trying to make a mental note of the parameters that control them. E.g. Rocchio Feedback - alpha controls the original query vector, beta controls the positive centroid vector and gamma controls the negative centroid vector REPLY: Well assuming I'm understanding Rocchio Feedback properly anyway REPLY: That's sorta what I am trying to do too REPLY: I've been relying heavily on the videos and lecture slides but whenever there's something that's not quite clicking I check out the book, it often does a great job of bridging the understanding gap that sometimes happens from watching the videos only. REPLY: yeah I found that reading book is really helpful… as it doesn’t have subtitle typo and I can control the tempo as well. And it’s better organized than in the video. You already took prof Zhai’s video so when you read it you can hear his voice lol

REPLY: I’m just assuming the worst REPLY: same REPLY: i have a terrible memory so i'm expecting this to be kinda rough lol REPLY: that’s exactly why anyone using this stuff (or doing further research / learning based on it) will have a reference handy rather than committing it to memory.  Memorizing equations is ridiculous IMO. REPLY: yeah I agree it doesnt teach you much trying to memorize an entire equation thats already been designed, btu I imagine the test will be more conceptual like a weight change etc.

REPLY: They have this weird athentication thing where it varifies that it's you by asking questions such as "which of these 4 streets did you live on" but I've taken a test where that bugged out, and they needed a second id. I used my passport, but I think something like a student ID or a ssn card would be fine. Most likely you won't need one, but it helps to have one available just in case REPLY: Cool ty. Offcampus student id(library card) doesn’t have photo in it so I guess I should prepare my passport just in case.

THREAD: metapy has the framework which can be used to drop stopwords.. but need to supply it a custom list of tokens a user wants to drop. There is an example of that in MP1  wget -nc <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt>  tok = metapy.analyzers.ListFilter(tok, “lemur-stopwords.txt”, metapy.analyzers.ListFilter.Type.Reject) tok.set_content(doc.content()) tokens = [token for token in tok] print(tokens) REPLY: Hmm that’s a bit different than what <@UAS9UN7DM> mentioned above.  Does the config.toml handle it already. I guess I can test it.  REPLY: Think it should be possible to do using .toml too, my understanding of that configuration is , it is markup representation of the runtime &amp; features available in library. Any meta toolkit API a user can use in through python, should also be available through markup. REPLY: I’m 90% sure MP2 is already removing those stop words by configuration, but you can test it by simply removing those stop-word configuration and see if result became different I guess REPLY: Yes, for MP2, in the config.toml, there is an explicit attribute for stopwords: stop-words = “stopwords.txt” REPLY: Confirm that it is taken into account: I have added dummy words from the corpus to see how it affects the rating and it indeed has an influence. REPLY: Also, tried (not too intensively) to change the default filter-chain, without improvement on overall score for now :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: your previous comment got me excited to experiment with a limited list of stopwords and see how it impacts ndcg on evaluation and test set but looks like not  much :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: well you can still touch those stopword to improve your ndcg@10 if that works REPLY: “Also, you are free to edit all files except:   .gitlab-ci.yml timeout.py competition.py” REPLY: so why not lol

Luckily finished my homework yesterday. Now all remains is prep for 2 exams &amp; tech review/project proposal. All the best! REPLY: I wish someone would have told me how consuming is CS425, would not have taking anything else with it! REPLY: Same here... It's been "fun" couple of weeks.

I should have taken it seriously :) Any ways, I have cancelled all the family events for next 2 months and am planning to take a week off before final exams to cleanup the backlogs.  REPLY: Yeah, I didn't take the warnings seriously enough either! There's no way I'm getting the Quiz 6 and Coursera Exam 1 taken before the midterm, so it's a good thing they aren't due until December (but that means I'm lacking study material going into the midterm).

THREAD: Guys do you know what is K1 and K3 in BM25 ?  I guess K1 is related to the TF transform part. ie `(k+1)x/(x+k)` and K3 is related to the IDF part ie. `log(M+1/K)`. in that case, k1 varies from 0 to 1 and the upper bound of K3 would be M. but according to the slide, K1, and K3 varies from 0 to inf. Not sure wht I'm missing here. REPLY: I believe your understanding is correct. Many descriptions of BM25 have something to the effect of `experiments have shown reasonable values are to set k_1 and k_3 to a value between 1.2 and 2 and b = 0.75. ` <https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/okapi-bm25-a-non-binary-model-1.html> I believe that only `b` is bound to 0 to 1. Help me understand which part make is look like k_1 would also be bound this way? REPLY: thanks <@UC4SXMPF1>. I checked the material again and realized that K can be large if we want to consider linear TF transform. I should have checked it earlier. srry. May be I was thinkin about `b` instead of k.

THREAD: you need to git submit only that file. REPLY: Thanks.  I have two questions: REPLY: 1)  By "git submit" do you mean we just upload it to the base directory of our project repository? REPLY: 2)  For lnL2, do we need to actually be running it in the final search_eval.py file we put in the repo?  This is where I'm getting confused. REPLY: I assume no, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to run anything else for the leaderboard. REPLY: 1) yes you need to stage the file by git add and then git commit REPLY: and then 2) you can run it in your local to see the number and submit the code so that pipeline kicks in and your alias (name ) shows up in leaderboard REPLY: you need to run your InL2 impl in your local anyway to get p-value 
THREAD: tech review submission due date is coming! REPLY: Don't worry it's only "Tech Review Topic Proposal" REPLY: yeah even that.. I have no idea so far lol 
THREAD: Whatever alias you set for mp2 will show up.  REPLY: Ya but my confusion was on what ranker to use at the end of this to reflect on the leaderboard. Is it my choice to use metapy or InL2? The grading says both pipelines have to pass. I ran the metapy ranker first commented it and then ran the Inl2 ranker. Is that correct? REPLY: that p-value is based on your InL2 implementation. They want to see the value and see if your implementation was correct or not ( or myabe close to ) compare to BM25. So end result will be 1) you submitted a file with p-value which is created by BM25 and InL2 impl and 2) your name(or alias) above the baseline of the leaderboard REPLY: 3) you get extra if you are top % of the scoreboard I guess REPLY: Thank you. This is helpful!

THREAD: I thought Tech review is an individual task REPLY: I thought Tech review is an individual task REPLY: tech review is individual task and it won’t be included in your grade. REPLY: I read the following about tech review in the Week 4 material: Working in a team is allowed for finishing the Technology Review; indeed, to the extent we can, we would attempt to compile all the submitted reviews into multiple handbooks to be made publicly available on the Web (e.g., “Handbook of Text Data Applications,” “Handbook of Software Toolkits for Text Retrieval and Analysis,” “Handbook of Emerging Techniques for Text Retrieval and Analysis”). However, to avoid complication in the coordination of team work, the size of a team should in general be no more than 3 members, but larger teams are also possible subject to the approval of the instructor. When working in a team, each team member must make substantial contributions to a review (i.e., must have written at least 1000 words). This means that a review produced by a team of 3 team members is expected to be much longer than a review produced by a single-student team. A review written by a team with more than one member must include a brief description of contribution of each individual member. REPLY: Also looks like it is going to be graded? The Technology Review will be graded based on completion of the following two tasks:  1. Topic proposal: Every student is required to select a topic from a provided topic list or propose a topic at Week 6, which is the time when the project proposals are due so the students can align the topic of the Technology Review with that of the course project. Students can work as a team to finish a Technology Review. In general, the size of the team should be no more than 3 members, but larger team is possible subject to the approval of the instructor.  2. Review submission: Each team is required to submit a complete Technology Review at Week 14. This deadline is set to an earlier time than that of course project code submission so as to give the students an opportunity to read some relevant reviews (especially those on toolkits) before finishing their projects if they want to. Details about how to submit the review will be posted later. REPLY: it will be graded based on your “completion”, so it’s just metric component. There is mention in week1 tech review section REPLY: “As I said, the technology review is not actually contributing to you grade, but it’s a metric component and it will be graded based on completion.” I am also interested in learning about resources we can use to do our tech review. 
THREAD: The subtitles are really bad on the videos, so many mistakes. If I trusted that my work would be used I would rewatch the videos and edit the srt file and fix it for them REPLY: I've been reporting those wrong typo in the subtitle but I'm done with it. It just has too much typo in there. Don't know if it's automatically translated or someone who speak English added subtitle though... REPLY: Where do you submit edits? I was looking for it and couldn't find it. All I found was if I was to translate it into another language.  REPLY: You can press “flag” on the video and report for those wrong subtitle I guess REPLY: but no way you can directly edit it. You can on coursera translation volunteer community, but that also needs some review from each language coordinators. REPLY: Ok that is what I thought then. 
THREAD: Please search the channel. It has mentioned more than 10 times in this channel. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> not sure if were replying to me here or someone else, because I've seen others ask the same thing with no follow up REPLY: Due date question/answer has mentioned several times here and on piazza.  REPLY: And it has delayed, not mistaken.  REPLY: Always check piazza first since professor and TA only reply on Piazza, they don’t come here and follow up.  
THREAD: It’s so annoying that when you solve the quiz, you hit 9 / 10, and instantly knew what’s wrong. And with your 2nd and last attempt, you correct the answer but then you made mistake for another question that you were correct in first try…. REPLY: Yeah, that just happened to me last week and I don't have the excuse that it was 3:00am... REPLY: I take a screenshot of the answers before the first submission and use it to double-check on the second try. I finished until Week 6 and So far, with this strategy, I got 100%. It's a little time-consuming, but it works. REPLY: I did that but mistake always happens :smile: REPLY: I’m half way done for week 6 REPLY: interesting that those issues comes to the machine learning, nothing surprise for nowadays though REPLY: :laughing: 
THREAD: Sure it’s good enough, and Spyder is OK, but Pycharm is a much better IDE, and VScode is a much better editor (also sublime text, and atom) - all of these are much more popular in industry than Spyder. Also Jupyter notebooks (supporting Python and R - and some other) are excellent , extremely popular in industry, and well worth learning. In summary, if you have to learn Spyder then I’d consider learning something else that you may get more use of later on. Or if you already know VI/VIM thats also decent, general purpose and very commonly used REPLY: Ok makes sense. I installed pycharm and was trying to update pip but its says pip version 18 already exists but its still using version 10. Got very confused and switched to Spyder. I will give it another shot. Thanks! 
THREAD: Just s thought but unless you’re planning a fair bit of complex python development pycharm is a lot to learn, and an editor like ms vscode might be a lighter weight option. Vscode now ships with anaconda as the default editing environment, and has syntax and autocomplete for most languages in this course, ie Java, c++, html, css, javascript, bash etc and of course python, so you don’t have to learn a new environment for each language. Anyway everyone has their preferences and there’s pros and cons of editors vs IDEs, but it’s definitely an option worth considering. REPLY: I love VS Code, it's become my go to editor these days. 
THREAD: Is the hackerrank required or optional? REPLY: What hackerrank? You mean the variable so that the leaderboard can be updated.  Yes it is a part of the CI/CD pipeline. You just need to do it once per MP.  REPLY: The real competition Implement the HITS algorithm REPLY: In this question, you are required to implement the HITS algorithm with a supported programming language of your choice. You must follow the initialization, normalization and iteration procedure specified in this reference (refer to page 403). You can use the sample test cases to debug your code, however the final test case is significantly larger and hence may require an efficient implementation. You must keep this in mind when you make your submission. REPLY: Never mind! 
THREAD: Could you please tell me how/which one do I install for an IDE? REPLY: how do you debug in jupyter notebook? REPLY: read the error? REPLY: There is no debugging utility so you have to just read what the interpreter gives you.  You can throw in print statements etc., old school style. REPLY: but it lets you run code in blocks, so you can run it in stages very easily REPLY: I installed pycharm. REPLY: Ran the following successfully in the terminal REPLY: pip install --upgrade pip  # install metapy! pip install metapy pytoml REPLY: then i tried running import metapy REPLY: but it gave me an error REPLY: what version of python and pip do you have? REPLY: Reason: Incompatible library version: metapy.so requires version 8.0.0 or later, but liblzma.5.dylib provides version 6.0.0 REPLY: python 3.7 REPLY: pip-18.0 REPLY: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31612086/cannot-get-ffmpeg-to-work-after-installing-from-homebrew> REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jky3wzh9mon231?cid=212> REPLY: I got a command not found brew error when i ran it REPLY: I guess I have to install brew as well? REPLY: <@U8H0CAD09> Cant thank you enough for guiding me through this! REPLY: no problem! REPLY: <@U8H0CAD09> <@U8GELQ7KN> If you want a debugger for Jupyter, pixiedebugger is supposed to be a really good visual debugger. I suspect pycharms is may be better, but the code in each Jupyter cell shouldn’t be that long to need super sophistication (you can also use pythons debugger pdb but it’s pretty basic “ import pdb; pdb.set_trace()” ) 
THREAD: How much experience do you have with python? REPLY: Zero :disappointed: 
THREAD: Hi! Forgive me for being so dumb, but where do we enter this: # Ensure your pip is up to date pip install --upgrade pip  # install metapy! pip install metapy pytoml REPLY: I usually use my terminal in pycharm as well, but you can also add them under settings REPLY: I used pycharm too 
THREAD: Anyone decided for a projec topic already? Decision should be due this week REPLY: Has the topic list been posted? REPLY: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/B0Gvz/course-project-overview> REPLY: " Every student is required to select a project topic from a list of given topics or proposal a topic around week 4." REPLY: Just waiting for the list to come out to see what is on there. REPLY: I asked the question on Piazza.. Hopefully we here something soon. REPLY: And just did one for the Technology Review paper that was discussed this week. REPLY: Same here. Just waiting.  REPLY: I proposed one but never heard back (private Piazza post to instructors) REPLY: good questions, thanks everyone for asking on Piazza as well REPLY: Still no update, right? It's already Thursday here in Korea.:cry: 
THREAD: Did anyone find documentation for the Python API in metapy? I am reduced to reading the Doxygen documentation for the C++ library MeTA and trying to figure out what the names would be in Python. This is ridiculous, what am I missing? REPLY: I don't think you are missing anything. This was a common complaint from the previous classes.  REPLY: This tutorial is useful, and so are the ones next to it: <https://meta-toolkit.org/KDD2017.html>. Still does not replace documentation. 
THREAD: Ugh. Taking those ProctorU exams is the thing I'm most dreading about these courses. REPLY: Why is that?  REPLY: They're really pretty convenient REPLY: I've had zero problems with them.  They have been easy to deal with especially once you figure out what they are looking for to do their job. REPLY: I'm sure it will be fine, it's just all the rules of where you can be, what you can have, and things out of your control like whether WiFi will go down in the middle of the exam... REPLY: If you schedule an exam at say 10am, be prepared to not actually start said exam until 10:30 or later. I've only taken 3 but all 3 took at least 30 minutes before all the issues were ironed out and I was allowed to start on the exam. Other then that it was fairly painless. REPLY: Basically, clean off your desk area. Have something like a mirror or your phone (unless using a webcam that can be moved) to show the proctors that you don't have answers written somewhere and you are not cheating.  If WIFI goes down, connect with them immediately and let them know and they will do their best to get you started again or they will reach out to the instructor to let them know.  That is all there is really to it.   They are there to ensure that the exam is given in the same sort of measured environment that someone on-premise would be receiving. REPLY: OK, I have scheduled my exam:zany_face: 
THREAD: hi all, is anyone else struggling with grasping certain concepts in this course. I don't know why but the info just isnt sticking like prior classes I've taken thus far? Mostly just want to know I'm not alone here haha REPLY: Sorry man you're all alone REPLY: Just kidding ... part of why I dropped 425 was to focus on 410 - I really want to understand the concepts and applications, rather than just rushing through things superficially REPLY: Im also struggling a little bit...well see how i do for mp1 REPLY: I am in the same boat and made a post on Piazza that said the same.  I'm looking for something more concrete instead of theory. I need to see this stuff work to really get it.  
THREAD: e.g., believing REPLY: thanks <@UC8GU2UBW> 
THREAD: If you have the green checkmark that means the unit tests passed and your code is good to go. REPLY: That is my assumption. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: That is just how CI/CD pipelines work. No real assumptions necessary.

THREAD: It looks like chapter 6 of the textbook covers the vector space model and statistical language models using the same motivating examples and diagrams as the lectures. So if you felt like the formulas flew by too fast to understand (I know I did), this might be a good way to dig deeper into the derivations. REPLY: Nice. I’ll definitely check it later.  REPLY: I kind of forgot all about the book, thanks for the reminder!

THREAD: Anyone has his/her all-inclusive Coursera account automatically being discontinued after starting this course? REPLY: the monthly ~$50 one? I can still use mine for other courses. REPLY: When course ha started, Coursera cancelled the existing subscription(49.99/mo), and those will be moved to your $158 for Courser fee.  REPLY: For some reason they decide to move it to your $158 and that’s all? I asked mcs-support for why I’m not ask to pay Coursera fee for first quiz submit, and that’s what they explained to me.  REPLY: I still don’t know if that means they’ll extra charge $158 - $49.99 or my previous $49.99 is going to cover all the $158. Seems like it should be the first case, but what’s actually happening is 2nd case?? Maybe they have so technical difficulties to solve this issue.  REPLY: Historically, I’ve had to pay both separately.  
THREAD: but this class has not charged me yet REPLY: I can't even submit quiz without paying REPLY: I took Data Visualization course didn't charge me money REPLY: that's strange... did you contact the coursera? <https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us> REPLY: I did but no reply REPLY: Same here, have taken the quizzes through week 2 but still no prompt to pay.

THREAD: Is it because account access issue? I tried to log in using my UIUC credentials, but cannot log in. Is everyone facing the same issue? I should probably start reading textbooks of CS410. Been fully occupied with ABM textbook and online materials to help understandings REPLY: Is it because account access issue? I tried to log in using my UIUC credentials, but cannot log in. Is everyone facing the same issue? I should probably start reading textbooks of CS410. Been fully occupied with ABM textbook and online materials to help understandings REPLY: I did the first two quizzes using only the videos.  But yesterday I finally downloaded the textbook PDF from the link that someone posted a while ago.b better explanations in some areas REPLY: No the textbook I have been reading is the PDF version that I downloaded from uiuc proxy server to ACM library. You should have no problem accessing them using your uiuc student nid and password.  
THREAD: It took me quite some time to digest all content in week 1 and revisited some of the stats learnt in my past degrees. Family time is more important for you:+1: REPLY: why is that? wanna join me with CS410 + ABM? REPLY: No just 410 to digest all of the contents. My babygirl is now three and I dont want to spend my whole evening and weekend only for this course. I want to have enough time with my family. :)  REPLY: And maybe too late to start ABM? It’s already 3rd week... REPLY: How’s ABM so far? Any public Coursera course I can take a look before considering enrollment? REPLY: I just read ABM course intro and syllabus. It’s advanced course that starts with 5 numbering and recommend students to spend 10-12 hours/week to digest all the materials. I don’t think CS410+ABM is going to be less load than CS410+425 lol.  REPLY: Great decision man, you can't get that age back. Enjoy your baby girl! REPLY: It took me quite some time to digest all content in week 1 and revisited some of the stats learnt in my past degrees. Family time is more important for you:+1: REPLY: Sound principled decision IMO REPLY: BTW what is the consequence dropping now? I am considering to focus on one course to maximize learning as well.  REPLY: If you drop before Sep 10th, I think you owe nothing to uiuc? REPLY: It doesn’t even record anything like you dropped the class in your transcript later, e.g with “w” IIRC. REPLY: If you drop a class before Sept 10th you do not pay for it (I'm referring specifically to dropping one class while retaining at least one class i.e. not withdrawing from the semester) REPLY: I'd say life is more important unless you have some type of rush to complete the degree. 
THREAD: Does have a recommendation for a good iPad app for reading big PDFs like the textbook? REPLY: I usually just open them in iBooks.

THREAD: Piazza Again, Is this still valid ? Can someone share active Piazza link ? I know many of us work and we use slack in an ASYNC way. Any additional info would be helpful. REPLY: Piazza is certainly still valid. All your classes are going to use Piazza.  There has not been a single class (this is my 4th) that Piazza wasn't essential and the primary way of communicating with other students as well as instructors.. REPLY: Also, Piazza I would say is probably more ASYNC than slack is so. REPLY: But it really isn't going to matter. No one searches in Slack or Piazza for previous discussions. They just post and run. 
THREAD: It’s just abstract concept of “hey I got terms and TF from there” thingy. It depends on how you are going to define “doc1” “doc2”. At least that’s what I was thinking when I was considering an implementation.  REPLY: I would agree. Doc is just the primary content that is trying to be determined if useful based on the query.

They are dependent on some separate group to make their DNS changes for them, and that separate group's work is abstracted by some FIFO queue. That group also doesn't perform these requests on weekends and holidays. REPLY: It's been discussed not only on here but in Piazza.

I use DevonThink document repository which even keeps the track of page number I am currently on.

Sadly, I'm on Windows 10 (my Ubuntu laptop magically died prematurely), so, just based on a quick Google search, I guess I couldn't use DevonThink, but it sounds really useful...

Btw i can’t find any link about which CS course is related to which coursera specialist course, including this 410. I see someone already questioned about it and got answered in the channel, but would love to see official course information for that.    REPLY: <https://cs.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/docs/Prof%20MCS-DS%20Degree%20Program%20Worksheet_0.pdf> REPLY: The text between the parenthesis are the Coursera courses.  Example:  "(Cloud Computing Concepts: Parts I &amp; II) )" is for CS425 REPLY: But that's just the Coursera Video side. .Not all courses are offered publicly as well as you are missing the big homework side of things. THat's where you need to look at the Class Syllabus. 
THREAD: On Coursera I don´t have any grade for my final project which make my record on Coursera bad REPLY: but can see the certificate from coursera? REPLY: Let me check REPLY: Yup… I can see it but with a low grade 
THREAD: Can you see your final grade in the UIUC student page ? REPLY: I can see my overall grade for the class, yes. 
THREAD: Thanks for pointing that out - I missed it in all of the Piazza chatter REPLY: While this may not matter to you - if you'd like I could look at your project (and you mine if you like).  I got full credit on my project and have decent amount of background in data science and machine learning.   Of course if *all* you care about is "why did I get this grade?"  - then I can't help you there: this would be as an offer to help you evaluate the content of your project - for learning purposes.    In any case the bulk of my project is here: <https://gitlab.textdata.org/sboesch2/topmetrics/> REPLY: I'm out at the moment, but when I get back I'll definitely take you up on your offer REPLY: k  whenever works for you

THREAD: ~generous~ fair grading. Letter Grade should give you bracket of % grade REPLY: I think they graded generously… REPLY: ~generous~ fair grading. Letter Grade should give you bracket of % grade REPLY: The breakup of the grading for the final project makes it hard for anyone to get a bad grade

THREAD: I'm not sure how intense the tech review is supposed to be. The description leads me to believe that we need to look up academic papers and cite previous research but on the other hand, my topic proposal (comparing two different python web scrapers) was approved even though it has probably been covered a million times which makes me think this should be a more informal exercise. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this? REPLY: I have similar question - I wish there was a bit more information on the expectations for the assignment. REPLY: Don’t overthink it. I am planning on a review based on commercial offering and maybe a paper.  REPLY: From previous courses I saw paper-like tech reviews REPLY: This is a on-completion task. It has no grade REPLY: So… Do what you can and enjoy learning, but focus on the course project  which is 25% REPLY: <@U5D824BQU> Where did you see the previous tech-reviews? REPLY: ok, thanks everybody REPLY: <@U5D824BQU> "On completion" ?  Would you mind to point out where/how you saw that?  I missed it. REPLY: You can find it on the instructions for this week :slightly_smiling_face: And they are talking about it in Piazza 
THREAD: I am curious to hear from anyone else who has taken some other courses in this program, but so far I have felt the CS410 has been basically worthless in terms of providing any real world skills.  I am wondering if this is an outlier or if most of the program is the same way? REPLY: I don't agree that it's been *completely* worthless, but I agree with the general sentiment that it's been a lower value class. I think the content and topics are worthwile, but the presentation has been a bit disorganized. I have a math background and feel quite comfortable with formula-based definitions, but on review I find that the slides often don't formally introduce the variables which makes it harder to follow. I've also found the lack of feedback and description of what's expected for the project and technology reviews to be very distracting. I understand that they are intended to be open-ended and up for interpretation, and perhaps I should be more proactive specifically *seeking* feedback or clarification, but overall it has made the course feel somewhat disorganized. The one other class I've taken so far in the program, Data Visualization, felt much better organized overall. REPLY: I would agree probably not "completely", but I will say that as the first course I have taken as part of this program I am highly disappointed so far.  I have also felt like the programming assignments are very odd/not representative of how you would approach these problems in the real world.  And don't get me started on Metapy.... REPLY: Yeah, they haven't been very representative of how things have worked so far in the industry, at least from my perspective. REPLY: I feel instead of quizzes, every week should have an assignment that reflects the content of the week with a direct correlation of what was learnt with the assignment REPLY: Quizzes are never a learning tool..atleast not the way it has been executed in all the MCSDS courses I have taken so far REPLY: CS-425 is the only exception.(assuming you have access to the classroom lectures) REPLY: Here's my two cents:  1. if people came into 410 with the expectation of getting practical experiences on an industry standard toolkit (ie: NLTK) then they are going to be disappointed. if they want a theoretical overview though they'd be pretty happy with the content.  2. I wish the programming assignments are more involved and doesn't just require two simple calls to some black box functions. Also metapy documentations could use some serious work. Personally, I'd rather have some tutorials teaching us the actual code and structure of the underlying MeTA toolkit (which does have something that at least has some semblance to a documented API) in C++ instead of using a poorly documented Python wrapper aka metapy just because it's Python. REPLY: I’m going to go against the grain here and say that this class has personally been useful in providing knowledge related to real-world applications. I am currently working on a project in R&amp;D phase that deals with text data and while I do have previous experience working with this type of data, the class has provided a lot of theoretical knowledge that I had been lacking resulting in more informed approaches to problems that come up.  I do agree with the sentiment that the programming assignments are lacking, however. MeTA seems like a good idea but the documentation is just really awful. REPLY: I do have to say that CS-410 Coursera lectures are way better  than the CS-412 lectures. REPLY: I expected to learn about core basics of text retrieval and analytics and this course exceeded my expectations. Once you have good grasp of basics, you will find the right library for your needs in the real world  REPLY: I give this course 8/10 - MP assignments could be made better REPLY: I'm in the minority here, but I have found this class useful. I appreciate the theoretical approach to determining page rank and probabilistic models, as well as how the instructor defined formulas for things like TF/IDF normalization and justified their importance.    As a software guy, I find this high level "conceptual" teaching important because I feel that I'll be able to very easily pick up the practical experience with toolkits, etc myself.  Reading API docs is the easy part.... REPLY: I felt the same way about CS425, so expect more of the same if you're taking that class at a later date.    My two favorite classes so far. REPLY: I'd still rank 425 to be the better of the two though. I found it to be more interesting and rigorous, especially the assignments. REPLY: Agreed. REPLY: I disagree about the quizzes:  I feel they are *v* important for verifying the learning.  The lectures are good quality.

THREAD: <@U5D824BQU> I posted a reply to one of your responses in Piazza, but you may not have seen it...I was wondering where you found the function names for the ranking functions (DirichletPrior(), OkapiBM25(), et al) because when I browsed through the API, all I could find were "pythonized" versions (i.e. dirichlet_prior, okapi_bm25, etc)... REPLY: @ryan , I just did  print (dir(metapy.index))  to find this . It's an easy way to find the supported methods and attributes of a class  REPLY: <@U57R64BGT> What a handy trick!

THREAD: People have a preference and are voicing it. "Aww man" is far from freaking out and to call it as such is an overreaction. REPLY: I really don't see anyone freaking out. REPLY: ok i apologize for my poor use of the word then i think nramaker  and my point still stands REPLY: Your "point" is apparently that the effort invested in the coding does not need to be useful for industry.  Ok - that is your opinion. Mine was that "why *not* make it more useful outside of the class". REPLY: Uh no? My point is the class is focused on core concepts not constructing elaborate projects that require you to link 30 different libraries on very specific setups. So if you invest the effort to gain a deep understanding of said concepts with a particular tool you should be able to spend a bit more effort to implement said concepts using whatever other tools of your choosing. Not to mention python is designed with ease of use in mind in the first place. REPLY: If the class was taught in python and now all of a sudden they decided to switch to c++, i'd say yeah that would be a strange move because they essentially decided to redo their infrastructure to introduce unnecessary overhead like learning how to compile cpp source properly. however it was already in c++ to begin with. if they want to switch to python, ok great. if they don't, well so be it nothing stops me from learning nltk on my own. REPLY: 30 different libraries ? well ok if that's what you think were involved in nltk.  Actually that *is* the case for *some* deep learning libraries: but not *this* library. REPLY: ? That is not what I said at all. I said the class *isn't* about complex projects that have a lot of external dependencies. It's about NLP concepts that are essentially language neutral. Nothing about NLTK man. 
THREAD: This is exactly what i mean. It's not like python is a difficult language to use. At the level we are working at if one really wants to learn to use nltk he should be able to go the extra mile and reproduce whatever he did in MeTA using nltk pretty easily (unless he used  features in MeTA thats missing from nltk of course) REPLY: This is exactly what i mean.

THREAD: Hey there <!here|@here>! Does anyone know a former student of this class I can talk to about workload? I’m considering taking 2 classes this fall, and I’d like to gather data about the sanity of this idea. REPLY: Which two are you planning to take, and have you taken any classes yet to give a frame of reference? Other students report that this is one of the lighter classes compared to some others, but it's hard to know what's right for your schedule. REPLY: Amongst all classes offered; yes, this is one of the lighter classes; but probably the best way to decide for yourself is taking Coursera MOOCs; in its last run; the class was just that - 2 Coursera courses + final project, which was open ended ( effort proportional to your own expectations; class did not set much of them ). So, imo; this class should NOT be taken alone unless someone is really constrained; but coupling it with CS425 or unseen ABM might not be wise.  REPLY: It’s very sane. CS 410 is fairly easy if you are confident in your ability to connect math to application.

THREAD: Presentation Video REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Per section 8 in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview instruction there is no such specific requirement that tells all team members required to speak in final presentation.  For final presentation I believe it can be a team decision if all team members want to participate or it can be just one speaker. A team introduction would be nice though to callout each team members' name irrespective of who is presenting.  
THREAD: Ranker.score function infinitely running in server REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team initially faced a similar situation when trying to run the ExpertSearch server code using python in command line and I believe it was getting stuck in the ranker.score function. But when we switched using the `gunicorn` launcher it was working fine. Although as part of our overall implementation we explored libraries compatible with python3.9 and had to eventually move away from metapy.  
THREAD: Final Project Documentation in README? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Per Section 7 in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview the Final project report need to be a written documentation and must cover all the elements mentioned in the section.   It can be in the same pdf format report like how we submitted the Project Proposal and Project Progress. However, I believe one team asked in post #1698 if they can put the project documentation in a README and TA responded that it is allowed too as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it. A nice benefit of README is it can be easily updated unlike pdf.   So, you can either create a Final Project pdf report and put it in the same place like the previous two project docs or the final report can be in the form of README too. Either way the report should cover all the elements mentioned in section 7 of project overview. I think it will be more like a team decision if they prefer pdf as final report or README. Both are allowed.   Also make sure you include link of the tutorial video presentation in your report as mentioned in Section 8 in the above Coursera link.    
THREAD: Final Project Video Requirement  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "At the end of the semester, every project team will be asked to submit a short tutorial presentation (e.g., a voiced ppt presentation) to explain how the developed software is to be used. The presentation must include (1) sufficient instructions on how to install the software if applicable, (2) sufficient instructions on how to use the software, and (3) at least one example of use case so as to allow a grader to use the provided use case to test the software. There is no strict length requirement for this video submission, but you should target at 5~10 minutes. A presentation shorter than 5 minutes is unlikely detailed enough to help users understand how to use the software, whereas a longer video than 10 minutes might be too long for impatient users. However, feel free to produce a longer presentation if needed. The tutorial presentation would be graded based on 1) completion of the presentation (10%); and 2) result of testing the software by graders (10%). If the software passes the test (i.e., is working as expected), full points will be given; otherwise, points will be deducted from the 10% allocated to the “result of testing the software by graders.” " REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: See Section 8 on https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  which is also shared on the below response.  Both documentation and presentation requirements are captured in that coursera link.  Regarding how you can upload and share the video link, see #1730 
THREAD: Final Project Documentation File Format? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If the final project documentation is README then the best place for it to keep is at the root level of the repo (like all the standard READMEs) so git can default display it for you. Generally README are best displayed in `README.md` format and here is one sample repo:  https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme  Also See #1698  
THREAD: Uploading Project Documentation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Shruti,  The project documentation needs to be uploaded in the GitHub repo as already done for the proposal and progress report.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: 1. Where are we supposed to upload the project documentation?  >>>The Project Documentation can be put in the same place where your team been putting the Project Proposal and Project Progress documents. Final project Report would be just another document.  However, one team asked if the project Documentation can be on README and the TA answered it can be on README too as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it. See #1698  2. And how do we share the Link for Project Video Recording? >>> The project video you can upload in any University provided video sharing resources and then add the presentation link either in the README or the Final ProjectReport whatever documentation you are providing.

So it should be "=" and not "<"  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The explanation is misleading.  You may regard it as a random variable, as firstly, you need to select a distribution \theta_k based on p_k.   Actually, \theta_k is a parameter / id / name of a distribution.  Consider a mixed model, given a \theta_i, you have a distribution. For sure, all the possible probalities sum to 1.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/9ceb39e6-a0a3-4c74-8e98-da47644e016a/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The sum should be 1 which is one of the constraints on PLSA.

THREAD: Can I reschedule if I run into technical issues with proctorU? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Send a private msg to TAs. It is possible. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had an issue where I didn't have my ID and had a late time lost. I was able to acquire my ID (20+ minutes) and take the exam with full time because the exam itself stays open until midnight I believe.  I did have to disconnect from the first proctor I had and wait for a new one, but still it was all fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can reschedule the exam for $8 to an earlier time to account for technical issues. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I originally had the last slot for exam 1 and decided to reschedule it a few hours earlier for the same concern. It's better to reschedule it now while you still can, then asking for an extension which you might not get. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ProctorU is actually pretty lenient as long as you check in at the right time. Also, they will provide technical support on the window. However, I would recommend choosing an earlier time slot to take the exam if you are really worried about it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I disconnected with the proctor personnel one time and the proctor pages closed suddenly. I tried to reconnect and the same person connected with me. We did the ID and room checking for a second time and continued with the exam. So don't worry, proctor staff will help you and just try to reconnect if any technical issue happen.

THREAD: Practice quiz 9 question 10 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is hard to understand. However, the meaning is correct though.  See below in pdf 9.1. We have topic and a background topic. They are mixed together.  \theta_d is related with the document d. It means different document, \theta_d may be different.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/86929ae8-2492-43e8-97e4-62fea10c3af1/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For the first option, we draw words from a a) mixture of topics (from the mixture model basically), and this mixing factor depends on the pi - recall that pi is related to a specific document AND topics (d,j) In the second option, a topic is nothing but a Unigram LM in our cases, where the mixing weight (probability of each word) only depends on the topic, if you recall.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! That makes sense REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Brilliant, thanks! Super helpful 
THREAD: Quiz9 q1 & q2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: First one is probability of words in generating documents from topics individually(as in a cluster) The second one is generating document from the mixture model used in topic modeling.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had discussed this with Professor Zhai. According to our discussion, The first question i.e. document clustering shouldn't be in Week-9 since rather it should be Week-10. The thin line is Document Clustering vs Mixture Model. In Document Clustering once a distribution is chosen using prior, all words are drawn from the same distribution. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 6]: From my understanding, it depends on whether the you look from word level first or document level first when generating the document. - In question 2, it requires using mixture model. You generate each word from all topic models then all words are included in the document. The calculation process is shown in the picture attached in your question.  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.56.56%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0fe8f08c-2fd1-494d-9a0c-c88963cd66b0/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.56.56%20AM.png)  - Question 1 is actually using text clustering model. You make decision about which topic the document belongs to first. Then all words in the document generate from the topic you selected in the first step. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.57.37%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a01fd65b-4bba-40b5-9c4e-17bfbc77d072/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-04%20at%2010.57.37%20AM.png)  In reality, the outputs of the two models are different and which one to use depends on what you are looking for. Here is an website I found that explains this. https://iksinc.online/2016/05/16/topic-modeling-and-document-clustering-whats-the-difference/ - Topic modeling is more filtering out topics that associate with clusters of words. - Clustering is more to group document and measure document similarity.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you a lot for the explanation! 
THREAD: quiz10 Q2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: According to SLM model, the sequence info is ignored. For more info, see below from Professor.  > While there are many different kinds of SLMs, we are particularly interested in the simplest one, i.e., the unigram language models. This model corresponds to a multinomial distribution over words. According to this model, a piece of text is "generated" by generating each word independently. As a result, the joint probability of generating all the words in a document D=w1 w2 ... wn is simply the product of generating each individual word, i.e., p(D)=p(w1)p(w2)...p(wn).      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: For the third option the likelihood will be squared. i.e. P = (p(w1)^2)(p(w2)^2)... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It doesn't have to be a unigram model. Think about a bigram model, we can only get w1w1 pattern in "w1w1w2w2...wnwn". 
THREAD: Week 11 Qn 4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: k-NN only computes for each data which one is its nearest neighbor and there is no weights to estimate. It does not estimate the weights, so this one is not true.  The other two are correct. For logistic regression, you can refer to page 4 of Week 11-1 slides (Text Categorization Discriminative Classifier). For Naive Bayes and K-NN, you can refer to page 6 of Week 10-8 slides (Text Categorization methods).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you so much.  
THREAD: Lecture 10.9 Score of a document for naive bayes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is just an example of binary classification . This just tells based on the score if d>0 this means the ratio P(θ1|d) > P(θ2|d) i.e the possibility on having the document being part of θ1 category is more than θ2 . In case of multiple labels, you can compare  the same by finding the Posterior probability of having θs given d    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you for the response, I was a bit confused by the notation, should it be a score(d, θ1) rather than just a score(d)? I was just wondering why θ1 is assumed to be the top and if there is a convention of it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here the score is an indication of the comparison between the probability of two categories. If the score is positive, it means the probability of $$\theta_1$$ is larger than $$\theta_2$$, and the classifier will predict $$\theta_1$$.   Here I think it is used to introduce Logistic Regression, which is a binary classifier. Therefore, it does not address the problem with 3 or more categories.  
THREAD: Practice Quiz 10 Q2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Although in the question it mentions "set of documents" - the scenarios mentioned in the multiple choice option is for a single document . I did not notice this unless you explicitly pointed it out :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ah, I see, so is it supposed to be the likelihood of word occurences in a document?   if so CMIIW, doubling every word should also not change it right? (it will be canceled out isn't it?) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: that's the way I interpreted  No, it will change - suppose d ={w1 w2}  So, ML here is 0.5 * .0.5 = 0.25  Now, d ={w1 w1 w2 w2 } So, the ML is  square(0.5) * square(0.5)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Set of documents means the entire collection . Each document has log likelihood and sum of  likelihood for all the documents should be the likelihood for the entire collection REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The maximum likelihood does not change since we are taking the product corresponding to each term and the order of the terms is irrelevant (i.e., does not change the product corresponding to those terms) 
THREAD: Do CS510 a good choice to take right after this course? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: They are independent. If you want to know more about similar things. The ABM is a good choice. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Maybe CS 447 Natural Language Processing if you are interested in the related topics, but it is offered in the fall semester.  Alternatively, ABM could be a good one.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Depending on you are on on-campus program or online program your options may vary.   For online students, options are much lesser so try to see the breadth requirements and advance course requirements. You have to take 4 courses from 4 breadths and 3 advance coursework.. remaining 1 can be elective. But at times a breadth coursework (like Deep Learning, Scientific Visualization)  can satisfy both breadth and advance course requirement at the same time, in in that case you have take more courses from elective or from same breadth. CS510 isn't available for online students but  CS 447 Natural Language Processing will be good option if someone want to explore more on NLP.  For on-campus program you have more available options and there might be a different coursework completion requirements. if CS 510: Advanced Information Retrieval available for on-campus student (should be) then it might be a good advance coursework option if you want to deep dive more into test retrieval. CS 447 Natural Language Processing will be good option too but not an advance coursework.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: @Jiecheng Zhao what's ABM stands for? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for the info! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ABM = Advanced Bayesian Modelling REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ...and CS410 satisfies the prereq. requirement for CS510 
THREAD: Are we asked to memorize any calculation formula for exam 2? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A similar question have been asked before.

THREAD: Week 11 Practice Quiz Question 11 Explanation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The first closest data is D1 which is 0.85, the second closest is D2 which is 0.7. One label 1 and another label 0 which conclude the answer. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your response. I do understand that part. My confusion is how the similarity values between documents indicate what label a document is.    Suppose in the D6 row, the values for D2 and D4 were switched, so the similarity between D6 and D2 is 0.1, and the similarity between D6 and D4 is 0.7. What would the prediction be in this case?  My guess is that the prediction would be 1, because k=2 indicates that I must pick the 2 closest neighbors, and both would be labeled 1. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This table here is a symmetric matrix since the distance between D6 and D2 are same as D2 and D6. So, you can not just switch 2 row values.. you need to make similar adjustment on the D2 row, D6 column & D4 row , D6 column as well . ( from your example ) .  Re: *My guess is that the prediction would be 1, because k=2 indicates that I must pick the 2 closest neighbors, and both would be labeled 1.* Yes, that's correct ..     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: *My confusion is how the similarity values between documents indicate what label a document is.* - Read column wise , ignore diagonal values , sort in descending order based on similarity value  - Identify top K documents and mark their labels , it can be either 0 or 1  - Whichever counts more, that is the category of the observed document , for tie - it can be either label.     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So in the scenario I came up with, the prediction would be 1 right?

THREAD: Week 11 Practice Quiz Problem 9: How Posterior Probability is Calculated REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: **Question 7**  P(w3|θ1) = 2/6 P(w4|θ1) = 0/6  P(d3|θ1) = [P(w3|θ1) * P(w4|θ1) ]= 0  **Question 9** This question is related to Question 8 where laplace smoothing is given  Form Bayes rule and laplace smoothing Posterior probability of seeing the document d3 in category 1 i.e θ1 is  P(θ1|d3) = P(w3|θ1) * P(w4|θ1) * P(θ1) = (2+1)/10    *  (0+1)/10   * 1/2  ( omitting denominator here since they are same )  P(θ2|d3) = P(w3|θ2) * P(w4|θ2) * P(θ2) = (1+1)/10    *  (1+1)/10   * 1/2  Note that  P(θ1) = P(θ2) =  1/2  P(θ1|d3) / P(θ2|d3)  = 3/4  So, from the above ratio of Posterior probability, possibility of having the document d3 is more in θ2 i.e Category 2      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: hey dude, can you help with calculating the question 8? From the bayesian inference we know that, $$P(\theta_{1} | d_3) = \frac{P(d_3 | \theta_{1}) * P(\theta_1)}{P(d_3)} = \frac{P(w_3 | \theta_1) * P(w_4 | \theta_1) * P(\theta_1)}{P(d_3)}$$, so my question is how to compute $$P(d_3)$$ here since I've tried plugging in $$P(d_3)$$ as $$P(w_3) * P(w_4)=\frac{3}{12} * \frac{1}{12}$$ and it's obviously not working though..  I'm just curious on how to get the value $$\frac{3}{7}$$. Thanks for any help! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: P(d3) = P(w3| θ1) * P(w4|θ1) * P(θ1) +  P(w3| θ2) * P(w4|θ2) * P(θ2)  Think that d3 can either be part of θ1 or θ2 , so P(d3) is the total Posterior probability of P(θ1|d3) +  P(θ2|d3)  Now, you plug your numbers like below  P(w3|θ1) = 3/(6+4) <--- |T1| =6 and |V| =4  P(w4|θ1) = 1/(6+4) P(w3|θ2) = 2/(6+4) P(w4|θ2) = 2/(6+4) P(θ1) = 0.5 P(θ2) = 0.5  You should get 3/7 now  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Was answered in #1558 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 9 Question 2: Why Background Component Does Not Improve Model Likelihood  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Background model helps you to isolate the stop words being selected as part of the topic . With this operation, we are really not improving the likelihood function but using ML estimator - we would able to filter the most frequent words from the topic   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, I guess this is where I am confused. How does isolating stop words not improve the likelihood function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Look at lecture 9.2 Probabilistic Topic Models: Mixture Model Estimation: Part 1 - Behaviour of Mixture model section ...

Additionally, in the README file you can mention to grab the API key from the CMT Abstract section. We have a similar situation like this and we are taking this approach.

You can simply use a stopwords txt file, load it into a python list, and pass it into the constructor of either of these functions.

THREAD: Has anyone implemented Gensim LDA with Priors? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I have used the scikitlearn implementation for LDA. It works well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for the pointer.  This helped me to find some good options (e.g. NMF is giving me some very good results).  Also, I can see that choices made in pre-processing have a big effect on topic quality.     I'll haven't tried priors with scikit but will.   
THREAD: Topic Analysis probability REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Based on word distribution process, there are two things that need to be solved:  1. whether the word come from topic model $$p(z=0|w)$$  2. what is the probability of w in topic model $$p(w|theta_d)$$   From my understanding, EM algorithm helps maximize the probability of the "topic" words in above two things through iteration. We use background model and words count as the known information to start with. As we don't know the $$p(w|theta_d)$$, we can assume some random probabilities. (lecture used equal distribution for each word) - E-step uses background model to filter out most-likely topic words and weight them more $$p(z=0|w)$$.  - M-step re-estimates $$p(w|theta_d)$$ by using $$p(z=0|w)$$ from E-step.   So each step you can adjust the value of $$p(w|theta_d)$$ which is also a local maximum. $$p(z=0|w)$$ is a by-product that explains how well the topic model explained the document.   ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-23%20at%2010.11.38%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5bdae152-5e88-4cab-bb2f-11f3afc189cb/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-23%20at%2010.11.38%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: this is a helpful explanation

THREAD: Dataset Changes for Final Project REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I would say send a private post to the Instructors/TAs mentioning the situation and follow their advice. You don't need to do anything immediate until you hear back from them.   You can also keep this post unresolved and they might respond here. But as this is thanksgiving week break and  best way to get attention from them is to send private post to them.

THREAD: How to manually create qrels.txt for query-document relevance? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Assuming a line corpus like in MP2, then the **doc id is the line # in the .dat file. The first line corresponds to doc id = 0.**  What might be helpful is to search for a single query, then print out its top results (showing both the doc_id and its contents). From there, it is easy to fill out your own queries.txt and qrels.txt file. Then repeat for the remaining queries you want in your evaluation.  Reading through https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/tutorials/2-search-and-ir-eval.ipynb is extremely helpful. Note in input [9], you can modify it so it prints out the d_id too. Also note that in order to access content from metadata as in Input [9], you need to add `store-full-text = true` to `line.toml`. I believe this function is limited to converting UTF-8 encoding though, so you might need to create your own function if your documents contain special characters not in UTF-8. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! This link is to the tutorial is quite helpful. Although for some reason  ``` idx.metadata(docid).get('content') ```  always returns none for me, even though I added store-full-text = true to line.toml. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: **Try deleting the /idx/ folder so that MetaPy creates a new one.** If an /idx/ folder already exists, MetaPy just loads it instead of creating a new one. So if you created an index earlier with a smaller corpus (say for testing purposes), then it might not be able to find the docid in your new, larger corpus because the index is outdated.  Check the size of idx/inv/metadata.db (or metadata.index, I forgot which one). It should be more than 1 KB, otherwise it's probably not storing any metadata. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That was the problem, after deleting the idx directory and recreating the index I can get the content now. Thanks! 
THREAD: Questions on final project submission REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I've just made it available, but the instructions here are minimal. Please refer to [Week 1 Course Project Overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview) for more detailed project submission information. 2. Yes, the documentation can be in the README, as long as it's clearly marked so that reviewers can find it.  3. If possible, you could set up a simple public-facing server where users can interact with your system. But if this is not possible, then providing the source code + a detailed software usage presentation video should be alright.   Best, Kevin REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For (3), it looks like part of the grading will be based on whether the reviewers will be able to run or interact with the system successfully. Without the credentials, the reviewers won't be able to try out my code. Will my project's grade get penalized for that?

THREAD: EM Algorithm with conjugate prior REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hmm... No response so far, does it mean that there's no other different interpretations of this algorithm? :)   It would be great if TAs or professor can confirm if this understanding is correct. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe you're right. There's only one prior on this example.  However, I don't think this prior is used for smoothing all the topics to reflect prior preferences. I believe in this case it is only used to smooth theta_j. The smoothing pseudo counts added when calculating p(w|theta_j) is essentially saying that, regardless of what is seen in the data in regards to theta_j, we already know/assume that "battery" and "life" are words that should have a strong probability (how much of the prior you want to add into the probability estimations is contolled by mu). However, for other topics tetha_j+1, tetha_j+2, etc...  we might not have any prior knowledge so we wouldn't add any other smoothing terms in the probability formula.   E.g. we might know for sure that we're looking at data that has do to with batter life (so you add your prior knowledge on that topic specifically), but perhaps we don't know if this data was gathered for mobile devices, home appliances, laptop computers, for reviews of only some countries or regions, etc, etc, which could be some of the other topics covered in your collection. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for sharing! After implementing the algorithm, I also came to realize that the prior should be used on only one topic, because otherwise all topics would be forced to cover similar topics, which doesn't make much sense.

THREAD: List of course items to complete REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Seems correct REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Almost Correct.   Couple of Items missed mainly the peer review portions. See below (rearranged your list below with added items): 1. Tech review (already submitted last week) 2. Project progress Report - Submit (Nov 15 at midnight CT) 3. Project Progress  Report - Peer Review (Nov 19th at midnight CT) 4. Final Exam  (Mon 11/29/21 12:00 AM CST - Sun 12/05/21 10:00 PM CST.) 5. Final Project Document and Presentation - Submit (12/09 at midnight CT) 6. Final Project Document and Presentation - Peer Review  (??)    The Coursera Grades section does provide a good summary too for completed and pending items along with due dates (coursera also doesn't show peer review deadlines although).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/806a464c-0a62-4178-a64d-db69d1d55a5c/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is correct but don't forget to also submit your peer reviews for the project progress reports in CMT REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: And also weekly quiz 
THREAD: When does progress report due? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: On Coursera, https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview it states: "Progress report (5%): Each project team is required to submit a short progress report by the beginning of Week 13 (Nov 15, 2021) listing the progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. It will be graded based on completion. " REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nov 15, 11:59 pm REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is supposed to be Nov 15, 11:59 PM CST.   Which timezone is your Coursera account set to? I changed mine to my local time zone manually and mine says Nov 16, 11:59 AM(Not PM) because I am located in Asia and am ~12 hours ahead of the CST timezone which is what the deadlines in this class use.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It's Nov 15, 11:59 PM CST. Coursera shows different deadline time according to you own system time zone. I'm in the Bay Area, and my Coursera shows 9:59 PM PDT. So you should be fine if you submitted the report according to your Coursera deadline time. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is due tonight! 
THREAD: EducationalWeb not working REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The link  http://educationalweb.web.illinois.edu isn't working for me either.   The last datetime google cached this page was Sep 9, 2021 23:44:42 GMT (cached linked below). http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tjjWkQj8iJMJ:timan102.cs.illinois.edu/explanation//+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us  You can let the professor and TAs know and see if they can do anything about it.  Additionally, you can also visit UIUC Tech Help Center at https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/42/UIUC/Home/ and open a Tech Request. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We have similar issues for another system. However, we have started it locally, and connect locally. You may try to run it locally also REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Have you tried to run the codes locally? In our case, we ran the codes locally, and implement queries in a localhost website. 
THREAD: Progress submission REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we just need to update Github! No need to do anything on CMT since that already links to our Github REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is correct! Then after the deadline, we just update our reviews on CMT to answer the progress report questions for the projects we're reviewing~ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, Amanda! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. Update the progress repo with a project progress doc with the below questions answered (as mentioned in post  #1639): 1. Which tasks have been completed? 2. Which tasks are pending? 3. Are you facing any challenges? 4. Plus anything specifically mentioned in the reviews to cover.  You may or maynot update CMT provided what you have provided already.  If you provided direct link to project proposal in CMT earlier, you may want to add direct link to project progress report too... Or you just leave with repo link and reviewer will find the project progress report. Either works.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we should also click the submit button on Coursera. 
THREAD: Dataset for Final Project REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I do not see any problem on this approach as long as your dataset is big enough to perform sentiment analysis but check with TA and mention this in your progress report  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is the dataset changing frequently? Is it possible to cache existing scrapes and only request the changes? Don't have context about your dataset, but I'm choosing to cache on my side and only look for new data. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Datasets like faculty  doesn't change much over the period of time...  Datasets like old news or an old event also wont  change over the period of time...  But datasets like daily news or daily tweets will change every day..   So the sentiment analysis is done on which datasets is the major factor that you take as a decision point.  You can definitely use the dataset that you scraped... But if you are planning doing the analysis on a changing dataset, things you can improve is by thinking how can you constantly update your dataset as parallel system so your indexed data is always current...   You can scope out your work but try achieving small steps at a time and take the agile approach.. See if you can implement sentiment analysis first on the scraped dataset and then see how can you improve the overall system once you have build confidence implementing the whole system with the vanilla flavor.  Also, You can always call out areas of improvement on your project so someone if interested can build on top of that (like  many teams are improving the ExpertSearch system as part of their project). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would suggest  scrape once - mention the date of scrapping in your report if necessary submit your data along with your report.  It is very difficult to be up to date with the dataset.   The project evaluation will not happen at the same time that you will scrape your dataset. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try to analyze how often your dataset is updated by scrapping in two different dates. After that present your results in your report and make the right assumptions for the project. I had the same issue as well, but fortunately I can quickly check the date of last update and do some type of transactional update in the dataset. 
THREAD: Grades for proposal + progress report due  
THREAD: Project Progress submission  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Yes, Progress report is a separate document. I think what you  have listed should cover all main questions to be answered in the progress report. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I copied over the table we created for the project proposal and gave feedback on each line item about the progress we made 
THREAD: Exam 1 score not shown in Coursera REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You should be able to see your exam scores in Coursera. if the issue continues after refreshing again then you might wanna reach out to the TAs about it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I can see mine. The only thing I can't see is "Project Proposal and Team Formation Submission for..." which hasn't been graded yet, I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I can see mine. You could verify your ProctorU account is linked to your UIUC ID, but I'm not sure that's necessary to get the grade synced. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could you see a percentage as following?  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/assignments   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks folks. I can see it now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I could see mine as well. In the past I had the problem when I took the last exam slot and due to my proctor interaction my exam finished after the deadline. I had to write to professor in order to my grade show up correctly 
THREAD: Latent Aspect Rating Analysis? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In week12, optional session. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The lecture is spread over two (optional) videos 12.1 and 12.2  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/week/12 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Why does the optional material show on quiz 12 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Good question. I think it's optional meaning it won't be on the exam REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Few more details on optional question in  #1572 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Check the optional lectures in week12. 
THREAD: "Due date has passed for 1 assignment items." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This has been discussed before #1478, #1543, #1615.  I see the same (i.e., "Submitted") as well on Coursera although the reviews are now out @CMT REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Think as long as you submitted before the due date it's fine, it's just taking time to get through the grading. Mine is the same way. 
THREAD: Progress Report  Template REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think you have to write about progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. The grading is based only on completion not on what you have mentioned. Therefore, you can use your judgement what to include. Please see below information from coursera  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1b8f4e0b-4133-4a9b-80ba-943afdd1cae4/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As we are peer-review for grading. I believe if you show enough effort and answer the question it will always be fine. A bullet-list for tasks and paragraph for challenge should be good enough. 
THREAD: ERROR: You are already scheduled for this exam REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This happened to me as well. You can talk to someone at ProctorU via chat and let them know which exam/time slot you want, and they can schedule it for you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This happened to me on the first exam. I haven't tried booking exam 2 yet, but **I was able to book exam 1 by following the link given in an email that you should have received regarding exam 2**. Look up the subject "Reservation invitation reminder" from noreply@protoru.com REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: This is known issue while scheduling the exam. Many students faced  this for Exam1 too.  You have couple of options (both were discussed on the other two replies): 1. You might have received a email on your illinois mailbox. with subject line `Reservation invitation reminder`. You can follow the invitation link and schedule the exam2 at proctoru website. 2. You can also always call/chat proctorU helpline and have them scheduled for you.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I too had the same issue but it was quickly resolved through "chat" at the bottom right of the page REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, this happened to me as well! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had this for exam 1 as well. Live chat support on ProctorU got it added to my cart pretty quickly in both cases. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue in my last course. Better to contact proctoru  through chat directly and ask them to fix. 
THREAD: Tech Review "Overdue" in grades REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think for 3 credit hour, its not needed ... Anyway, this does not carry any mark , just pass/fail and this is mandatory for 4-credit students REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The tech review is only for 4 credit hour sections, so I think you should be fine REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: #70 Please see post from TA. You should be good. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This is a pass/fail assignment, think it's fine as long as you submitted prior to the due date.

Even you put some NA.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Fill in the parts you can and submit it, then later go back to fill out the other parts as they become due REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can return to review later and update the missing information.

THREAD: Progress Report Submission REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The section for project progress submission seems still locked (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/pReV0/project-progress-report-submission-for-grading). So TAs might unlock it soon with further instructions added and/or possibly they will make an announcement here as well as the date approaches.   https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/GKzxo/course-project-overview contains some information what need to included part of project progress report but doesn't mention anything about submission in there.  I believe we have to upload another document (Project Progress document) on our same Course Project Repository of Github (maybe some work in progress code too) but will wait for Instructors/TAs to confirm. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We have to submit it in the same project repo containing the project proposals. I think it's still locked in Coursera at the moment  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1639 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1639 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nice.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would review all the projects that shows up on the Reviewer console in CMT. If you are not able to review any specific project for any specific reason, I would suggest to send private post to TAs and see what they says.   The peer review is also a great way of receiving feedback from fellow classmates which at times might improve the project quality. Other than grade this is another benefit of the peer review process.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you likely did not accept the invitation that was sent out earlier to be a reviewer. Check your email for it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is safer to finish the review. My suggestion is to spend some time completing it.

Check the console in livelabdata submission if you can grab the specific error message 2. Make sure you open the livelabdata using the "Open Tools" option from theCourtsera tech Review Submission page and try again pushing your file.   3. Your tech_review github repo must be public.  4. The tech review file name must be `techreview.pdf`.  5. Sometimes, there are issues with WebHook, check if webhook has the right url and no warning sign [unlikely in this case] 6. Check if your Token expired. If yes,  unliknk the account and re-link using a new API Token 7. If everything good, sometimes just unlinking the account and relinking also worked for few students.

THREAD: Week 11 Practical Quiz 10 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to find the k documents that are more similar to D6, (for question 10 k=1), then use the label of that document for D6. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since the similarity score of 0.85 is the highest in the D6 line, D6 is similar to D1 (?). So, we assign D1's class to D6 => label=1 for D6 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As $$k=1$$, you need to fine the one document that is nearest to D6. In the table of D6 column, D1 has the largest number 0.85 so it is the one that is closest to D6. So D6 should assign the same label as D1 which is 1. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-11-07%20at%208.47.34%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2729c349-5139-4a00-b24b-2c22faf04a0f/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-07%20at%208.47.34%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The idea behind KNN is to make groups based on similarities between nodes. But the question then is: How many nodes would you consider (as neighbours)? You can't assume the whole data set as being similar, otherwise you are just making a big single group, which would be rather meaningless. The k value tells you the number of nodes you should consider as neighbours. If k = 1 you are looking for just one node closest to you - closest means most similar. The question actually simplifies the "similarity logic" by providing a score between two nodes indicating how similar they are. So for D6, you just pick up the highest score (thus highest similarity) for k=1. D1 is that node (you look at the column/row title, and the score is similarity between the column/row titled node). now, you just look at the label D1 has - since D6 would belong to the same group.  In another question you would find a different value of k. there you are looking for different number of neighbours and trying to look at their labels, and that complicates the question a little bit. In general k=1 would be the easiest as having a single feature/label would not have ambiguity. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The nearest neighbor will have the highest similarity with D6 (i.e., D1).

Like will you consider using the described approach (why or why not)?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You only need to tell a story. If it is complete, it is fine.  I introduced a python package, which is useful to text processing.  You may read a paper, and try to show the main messages.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/NROf1/technology-review-submission  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can also browse through multiple tech review submissions (on the sign up sheet) and see how classmates presented the tech review and you might get some reference too.  Once you are decided on the technology to review, you are not required to "judge" but you can always share your thoughts in and around the technology. You can share your observations, what you have learnt from the technology, what are the benefits of its, where it can be most contributing, anything you were not able to understand etc. This is more like your take on that technology and putting that in a tech review paper. Good Luck.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I felt the same, but what helped was i looked at related work section in the paper and the reference papers and saw how other studies approached the problem. then i discussed their pros and cons based on the limitations that they say in their papers. i don't think you *have* to judge its efficacy and use - studies are continuously working to improve existing work. just try to compare to other similar work and see how one system may be better/different! 
THREAD: How do I check if I am taking this course for 4 or 3 credits? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you go on self service and view your schedule for this semester (on the course registration website), it'll tell you the number of credit hours!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Login to [UIUC Self Service](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/) Navigate to Registration & Records and under Classic or Enhanced Registration or even under View Academic History. You can check whether you have 3 credits or 4 credits. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it's automatically 4 credits for us MCS-DS students. I just checked (it's 4 for me) and I dont remember looking at or thinking about number of credits at all when registering REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you are taking a online master degree, probably it is 4 credits. (this is for my case) If you are taking a campus class for a bachelor degree, probably it is 3 credits.  After all, you should know your program REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can check via Self Service but I believe it's 4 credits for all graduate students 
THREAD: Required Questions for Progress Report REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview it states:  "Progress report (5%): Each project team is required to submit a short progress report by the beginning of Week 13 (Nov 15, 2021) listing the progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. It will be graded based on completion. " From the above, I'm guessing that the questions to be answered are:  1. What progress was made 2. What tasks remain 3. What challenges/issues were faced

THREAD: Project review question REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we will be assigned the same project for the later phases as well.  Leaving it unresolved so that the TAs can add their comments if otherwise.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I suspect (prefer?) that it'll be randomly assigned for the next rounds so the number of projects reviewed by each of us evens out (i.e., those who reviewed 3 now will hopefully get 1 project to review in the next round and vice versa) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you will be assigned the same projects. For future deadlines, all you will have to do is update your answers to the reviews.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks !! ... It makes sense as it takes time to review each project properly and a few projects assigned to me are quite interesting and hoping to learn from them as well. Different random set of project does defeat the purpose here, thanks again  
THREAD: exam 2 questions REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: TA and Instructors will be able to confirm this but so far in this program i haven't seen questions from optional part are being asked in Exams.  One possibility is few lecture videos might have been recently marked as optional as they review the course structure every year and at times make minor adjustments. And while marking a video lecture as optional they might have forgot to remove the corresponding question from quiz.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: as one of the TAs had mentioned for the last exam that there will be no material in exam1 or the quiz from optional material. so I'm under the impression that this will be the same for exam2 as well. but it would be better if the TAs can comment on this.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The professor mentioned in one of his office hours that optional materials won't be included in the exams. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I hope that comment is not made for exam 1  
THREAD: How many review we should submit? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have reviewed Paper 121 and submitted the feedback. How can I get the new proposal to review?

THREAD: Topic proposal REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would strongly recommend to send a Post/Note to professor and TA immediately. Tell them the reason for delay and they might still consider in some exceptional case. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thanks for your suggestion Kushagra.

THREAD: Unable to find anything to review REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: We are asked to submit the github link only (which contains all the project-related files). I can see the pdf in the link. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Got it. Thanks, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Copy and paste that GitHub link in your browser. The proposal should be in their GitHub repository. 
THREAD: Technology Review Topic Change REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you can. I asked the same question to TAs and they agreed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was answered in #1330: "Yes, changing your tech review subject to be related to your final project is allowed." 
THREAD: Question for Week11 Practice Q5 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I chose 1/3 since there are three data points (d1, d2, and d3) and only one of them (d1) is spam. Perhaps this is just coincidental but there are 12 (non-unique) words in all and 4 of them correspond to spam.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did the same and no option for 2/5. But a little confused why use document count not word count here.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What I understood is that the question is related to the prior probability, so we just to normalize the document count for the spam category. As in P(theta=spam) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You may go to slide 10.9 page 7, and the answer is there. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1e310c09-a36e-4bab-8e90-04e855fb44a7/image.png) 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 11 Question REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In Practice Quiz 11 Q8, we already have$$P(theta1/d3)=3/7$$. So $$P(theta2/d3)=4/7$$. As it has higher probability for $$P(theta2/d3)$$, d3 belongs to $$theta 2$$ which is category2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: P(θ1|d3) = p(d3|θ1) / ( p(d3|θ1)+ p(d3|θ2) ) = (1/10 * 3/ 10) / ( (1/10 * 3/ 10) + (2/10 * 2/ 10) ) = 3/7   P(θ2|d3) = p(d3|θ2) / ( p(d3|θ1)+ p(d3|θ2) ) = (2/10 * 2/ 10) / ( (1/10 * 3/ 10) + (2/10 * 2/ 10) ) = 4/7  We select the higher of the two, which corresponds to category 2. 
THREAD: Micro Average (Practice Q11) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Precision = TP/(TP+FP) = count of y(+)/(count of y(+) + count of y(-))  = 7/(7+1)  = 7/8  Recall = TP/(TP+FN) = count of y(+)/ (count of y(+) + count of n(+)) = 7/(7+1) = 7/8  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Consider the entire matrix for the calculation here  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: For micro - averaging, you look at all the values from all categories & docs to calculate P & R. This contrasts with macro - averaging, where you would aggregate over either all of the docs or all of the categories (but not both). The formulas for P & R are the same, but for micro - averaging, you look at all the values in the table 
THREAD: Metapy returns None when trying to get the content of document in the index REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You need to add store-full-text = true in the line.toml file. Then delete the current idx folder and rerun your code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you- this worked! 
THREAD: MP3 log likelihood not increasing REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: please check if all the matrices normalized properly, this will automatically fix likelihood problem REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, very important to also know what axis of the matrix you are normalizing on. I was missing that one step in my E-step. Thanks! 
THREAD: Tech Review github link and references REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As post #1330, TA confirmed that we can change tech review and reminded us submit it before deadline. I think it should be fine to change your reference link in the sign-up sheet as you are graded by your submission not sign-up sheet. Sign-up sheet is used for later TA or classmates review as our tech review is saved in the public repo. 
THREAD: Generative vs Discriminative in Logistic Regression REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the difference between discriminative classifiers and generative classifiers is that discriminative classifiers try to model p(Y|X) directly while generative classifiers try to model  p(Y, X) first. 
THREAD: tech review paper - figures REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe so. As long as you show enough effort and do not use the figure simply to make up word count it should be fine. See #1545  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As per https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages " No mention of figures, unless these are part of the storyline? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As mentioned in #1545, architectures/images/diagrams/codes can be put in tech review paper but if they take significant portion of the paper then the paper might be needed to extend beyond 2 pages. No official limit in no. of pages. The actual review content (the textual content) is expected to be around ~2 pages.   Also make sure to add proper citations if the architectures/images/diagrams/codes are not completely yours.    
THREAD: Tech Review Spacing REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: As per https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages "   There is no formatting instructions. So, it's most likely "free form" as long as the "coherent storyline", "cite relevant references", and "at least ~2 pages" are there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Specific format wasn't mentioned. The guidelines just says "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references."  So it might not need any specific templates but just a good flow of the sections along with references.  But for neat documentation and presentable format if you are looking for any standard templates, I think any of these standard templates can be used (nothing mandatory):  **IEEE Template** https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx  **SIGKDD Template** https://www.kdd.org/formats/template.doc 
THREAD: Can Tech review contain code snippets and Images ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not aware of any scenario why the tech review can't have images or code snippets.   However, if the code snippets and images you referenced from somewhere else you would need to do the citation. But if they are yours then citations wont be needed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yeah, I am kind of creating them on my own... But wanted to confirm from TA or professor.. If its allowed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think it is okay to create image/code snip it, but it should not be included as your 2 pages count. So, i would adjust the number pages if you have a lot of image/code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, code snippets and images are fine. Like others have said, remember to cite and try not to have them take up significant portions of the two pages (it's ok to go over if needed).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is there a limit of 2 pages for the tech review? What is the maximum page limit? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't believe there is a specific page limit, but try to keep it around 2 pages of text plus any images or code that you include.  
THREAD: Practice Quiz 11: Question 6 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is how I answered this question. I may be wrong. Q5 has "d1" as the only one with Spam and has words:  Save Money No Fees  For Q6, the only option with just these four words or their subset is the first choice: "no fees" The other choices have "ham" words. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: There is a hint at the end of question6 to refer to lecture 11.1.  - $$P(Spam)/P(Ham)$$ is determined in question 5 and it is the same for all options.  - Word count is 1 for each term. So it is same as well for all. - $$P(w|Span)/P(w|Ham)$$ is the only one that affects the score. As "no fees" has no ham term, P(w|Ham) is 0 which means $$P(w|Span)/P(w|Ham)$$ is almost infinite. As all options have two Span terms, phase with only Span terms have two largest value which lead to the largest total score. All the others have larger denominators which means lower scores.

Very helpful. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: how do we know it is p(w | spam)/p(w | ham) and not the other way p(w | ham)/p(w | spam) ? like where is it said which is theta 1 and theta 2? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Doesn't matter which is nominator and which is denominator but score meaning flips.  - If the ratio $$p(w | spam)/p(w | ham)$$ is high, then the w is more likely from category spam - If the ratio flips as $$p(w | ham)/p(w | spam) $$, high ratio means w is more likely from category ham.   
THREAD: Tech Review Content REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I think that's okay to do. As long as your review has a flow Intro, body, conclusion and at least 2 pages. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe this is encouraged, as per this part of the tech review instructions:  "The deadline is set to an earlier time than that of course project code submission so as to give the students an opportunity to read some relevant reviews (especially those on toolkits) before finishing their projects if they want to. " 
THREAD: SVM, training error and nonlinear decision boundaries REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I can't speak to best practices for choosing appropriate kernels (just cross-validation maybe?) but kernelized SVM is absolutely a thing, you can see `kernel` arguments in popular implementations [like sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)  there is also a way to modify the SVM objective function to allow for misclassifications. basically instead of a "hard" margin, you can have a "soft" margin that allow some points to be on the wrong side of the decision boundary, with a penalty increasing with the size of the distance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the reference. I'm curious about best practices for text categorization. For example, I can see kernel usage leading to overfitting the training data. If I have time I'll poke around some. 
THREAD: Logistic Regression Equation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: you have probably seen this definition of the sigmoid: $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$   multiply by $$\frac{e^z}{e^z}$$: $$\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\frac{e^z}{e^z} = \frac{e^z}{e^z+e^ze^{-z}} = \frac{e^z}{e^z+1}$$  And they just substitute in $$z=\beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^Mx_i\beta_i$$ to get the form shown there. If the form of $$z$$ is confusing, it's just an expanded way of writing $$z = \beta^T X$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/eb01bda4-8651-4d51-bbeb-cd725da65d63/image.png)  So, what we have is $\sigma_t = p(Y=1|X)$ , which has a range from 0 to 1. For the right hand side, we have $t$ equal the exponent ($\Beta_o +...$   
THREAD: Cannot Find Proposal Review on Github REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same here :D  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe that is your review comment to the first project proposal question that it is not available for you to review so it is sent back to author to resubmit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same here as well. But I could download the proposal by clicking "Download." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you are not able to find any file (pdf or doc or docx) as part of the project proposal in the git repository, then I would also send a private post to the Instructors and see what their advice is.  Maybe the team did an attachment on the CMT itself or might have just missed uploading to git. Instructors would be able to best advice on next steps if a proposal document is missing from the git repo to review.   For example. for one of my review assignment came as attached document available to download from CMT, like this ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e89775c9-d04b-43c0-8be4-b0e3f17d34b3/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did not see the Download button on the CMT itself either. I did an exhaustive search but nothing turned up, so I submitted the review saying I couldn't find the proposal.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Make sure you open the tool inside Coursera when submitting. It should be on the tech review submission page inside Coursera.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Not sure if you already tried this one but with the nature of the issue you mentioned, this is one of the most common reason why this happens.  When login in livelabdata did you open  livelabdata using the "Open Tool" option on Tech Review Submission Page on Coursera. This mainly happens due to livelabdata not loged in using the "Open Tool" Button.  If not (or not sure) then logout and login in livelabdata using the "Open Tool" button and re-push the tech review from git hub generally works.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1c68d640-e82e-4630-9cd4-a6592deb7261/image.png)   
THREAD: Leaderboard Shows 0 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Leaderboard score is 1 when success (atleast what I have seen happened to me so far).  See if your MP3 Coursera grades are updated too.   If you have got your MP3 Coursera grade too then I would just notify TA/Instructors letting them know about the observation.   If your  your MP3 Coursera grade is not yet updated, then also I would get in touch with instructors either in a private post or in office hours to have them a look into your solution and help you find the root cause.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe success only means that your code is able to execute without any issues. so when you get a 0 on the leaderboard, it probably means that your code does not meet the grading criteria and did not pass any test cases due to which it gives you a 0 irrespective of the fact of the grader output of success.  It would be best if you get it to clarify with the TAs. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Grader Success means your code compiled successfully. Leaderboard 0: Your code did not pass test sets - No points awarded Leaderboard 1: Your code passed test sets - 100% points awarded. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For MP3, did anyone else face this too? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I had this issue in MP3 initially. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had this issue as well. It appears that getting the "success" output merely means the code was able to compile, but you won't get a 1 on the Leaderboard unless your code passes the tests and satisfies the instructions correctly.

Based on the information provided  here 	https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/1gMIe/syllabus  Quizzes  25% Programming Assignments 25% Course Project 20% Exam 1 15% Exam 2 15% REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: So far I haven't seen that information being made available in Coursera or by professor in middle of the course as "progressive" or "current" grade in class.   However, on your Coursera grades section you will be able to see a snapshot of your itemized grades you achieved so far (quiz, MP, tech review, Exam etc).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cb451fa1-c6c0-4542-a043-1ffff257e78e/image.png)  In Slack or in Campuswirse there were voting done for Mid term Exam scores where you can see the data about students scores voted anonymously.    Final grade is something that is done at the end of the course and  would depend on multiple factors (and might also include curving depending on the instructor). I never heard of them doing any current grades so I wouldn't expect that.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Use this calculator (coursera grades hypothetical) 1. Quiz: Your grade (e.g. 90% on coursera) * 25 = 22.5 (hypothetical) 2. MP: Your grade (e.g. 100% on Coursera) * 25 = 25 (hypothetical) 3. Exam 1: Your Grade (e.g. 80% on Coursera) * 15 = 12 (hypothetical)  Add 1 + 2 + 3 = (22.5 + 25 + 12) = 59.5   Grades for  4. Exam 2:  Grade you will get * 15  5. Project: Grade you will get * 20 (if you submit everything as per deadlines you will surely get 18 (90%))  Add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 = say 92 -> corresponds to A   There is an extra credit of up to 5 points for contributing to Campuswire.

THREAD: Technology review clarification REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Best would be take advice from instructors.  But what I understood is those links/papers are for your references only. You can search more stuff on internet, cite them as references and then put all your review thoughts on that technology on your technology review paper. More research you will do deeper understanding you will have on the technology to review. It is mainly how you are reviewing a technology which is related to the course but might not have been taught in the course. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here's some info I found helpful from the assignment description   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/748cbe83-5234-417b-8ea5-de2b5fa6d116/image.png)  The tech review is supposed to contain novel content, so it's probably a good idea to use additional papers as well

THREAD: Technology review clarification REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: as per the description in Coursera "Technology Review assignment is designed to provide students with an opportunity to go beyond the materials covered in the course lectures to learn about an interesting course-related cutting-edge technology topic not covered in any lecture." you can think of it as a research paper on the topic of your interest. we do not need CMT for this.  CMT is only for the group project.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was discussed in #1485 as well. There was no mention of CMT for this assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I think it would be similar to the research paper, but you don't have to do much experiment. Just summarize the paper you read, and talk about how such technology can be applied to text information systems. You should have your own perspective in your work. 2. No. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You are expected to review papers related to this course, following the topic you wrote in the signup sheet. You should give your own opinions about the papers. This is an individual assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I strongly recommend starting this assignment early especially if your group work has a similar topic. 
THREAD: Will we know when we've been assigned proposals to review? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think you can periodically check your CMT login under Reviewer tab and the reviews will show up there. Not sure if we will get an email once we are assigned in CMT. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This was addressed here #1458 and #1478  We first need to get an invite from CMT  as per https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview  "Later in the semester, you will receive an email from CMT inviting you as a reviewer, and we will make an announcement when the emails are sent." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The most recent post #1491 seemed to suggest that reviewers would be assigned individually and we could check the website for updates. Because the review timeline has changed a bit, I was just curious about the most up to date information regarding email notifications as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'll make an announcement on Campuswire once the reviews are assigned - still waiting on students to accept the invitation.

THREAD: Normalization in Expectation Step REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: These are two different sets - the set of "vocabulary within a topic" and the set of "topic within a document". So, after normalization, everything within a topic sums to one and everything within a document sums to one.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: im sorry for not understanding but, let's say:  document A is comprised of topic 1 and topic 2 topic 1 has 2 words, both with .5 probability  topic 2 has 2 words, both with .5 probability  each word in topic 1 and in topic 2 will sum to 1 ("vocabulary within a topic")  Then, how can each "topic within a document" sum to 1? If each word within a topic sums to 1, and you have k topics, then each topic within a document will sum to k  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Consider a set of cars = {c1, c2, c3}. Assume that each element occurs with equal probability. I.e., p(c1)=p(c2)=p(c3)=1/3 So, for set of cars, p(c1)+p(c2)+p(c3)=1  Now consider another set with cars (c1, c2, c3) and trucks (t1, t2). So, we have a set of vehicles{c1, c2, c3, t1, t2}, each with equal (need not be, but for illustrative purposes) probability. I.e., in this set (of vehicles), p(c1)=p(c2)=p(c3)=p(t1)=p(t2)=1/5.  So, we can say, for the vehicle set, p(cars) + p(trucks) = 1.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: so then, would be safe to say in this example: - We have normalized the cars set - We have normalized the trucks set - After the above sets are normalized, we have normalized the vehicles set (encompasses both Cars and Trucks) ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: " Thus, in self.topic_prob, each vocabulary within a topic should sum to 1, but then each topic within a document should also sum to 1? " this is not correct. here each vocabulary term across all the topics should sum to 1.  
THREAD: practice quiz 11: Assume the same setup as in Question 10. If k = 2, then the prediction would be: REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The answer to Q4: "k-NN only computes for each data which one is its nearest neighbor and there is no weights to estimate."  I.e., no higher (lower) weight for a data point that is closer (farther) to signify influence.  Slide 6 in 11-1 recording states, "Can be improved by considering the distance of a neighbor (a closer neighbor has more influence" I guess this "improvement" is not a part of the core KNN REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i see thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Right, for k-NN you do not appear to take distance into account when determining nearest neighbor weighting.

Here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/FKWgc/technology-review-information  , it states:  "Review submission: Each student is required to submit a complete Technology Review by the end of Week 11 (Nov 7, 2021).  The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages " REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, only the pdf document needs to be submitted via Github. and i think we need to update the spreadsheet as well with the git repo link.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Yes you need to fork the tech review branch to your repo and upload the document named "techreview.pdf" to GitHub and then go to Leader Board and submit just like you do for MP assignments. Once you do that, you can take the PDF URL and update the sign up sheet. Once you submit the tech review in Leader Board, your Coursera will show the score as 1 (Although TAs will still review it later).

So please make sure to check whether there is already a review on the topic before you devote time to complete a review. If you find an existing review on the topic, you may still write about the topic, but just need to make sure that you take a somewhat different perspective than the existing review or add new content on top of the existing review (i.e., extending it in some way)." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm aware, but this does not seem to be enforced. If you look at the sign up doc, there is a ton of overlapping topics and descriptions. There should've been some "approval" or "lock in" phase to kind of guarantee no overlap. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the overlap here refers to "existing literature or web pages" and not among the descriptions we write REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: At least you should have something new, no matter topics/descriptions or perspectives.

Also, bear in mind that recommended hours to spend are about 20.   Based on time you have for the project and also your interest you can decide the complexity and features in your app. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here, https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview   "Thus, your course project work would be graded primarily based on your effort. If you have followed our guidelines and completed all the required tasks, you should receive at least 90% of the total points for the project. This is to encourage the students to pay attention to time management and set realistic goals that can actually be completed by the end of the semester. The remaining 10% is based on how well your software works; a fully functioning software would be given the whole 10%, whereas a buggy software or a software with missing functions would result in losing some of the 10% of the grade." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I suggest good documentation (like using GitHub branches/Trello) and specifying everybody's work and time spent would be a good practice to succeed in this project. 
THREAD: Do E or M step need to have for loops? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah you are correct. I ended up using for loops with a combination of numpy while writing my code at first. I find it easier to debug and understand with loops, then once you get a handle on the matrix operations and how all the matrices need to interact, modify the code and sub-in the needed numpy functions and parameters (like einsum). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i used both! 1. einsum to get the overall dimensions for E and M step. 2. for-loops for the normalization part. you could just forego for-loops, but doing a for-loop for normalization gave me good sanity check that i was doing the normalization correctly. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Human mind can hold 2D matrix multiplications - 3D is a stretch :-) Between easy but a bit longer; and complicated and shorter - I would suggest go with longer (loops) unless the easier version is very performance heavy- especially when the concept is new to you. what you lose in line brevity would be gained multiples times in clarity. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Completely Agree with Alok, spend a lot of time on 3D matrix multiplication and after cracking it I thought its much easier to do 2D multiplication with a simple for loop for one dimension ...   
THREAD: clarification regarding likelihood REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: self.likelihood should be an array of length (# of docs), representing the calculated value for all docs for the current iteration.  The array can be summed up for comparison between the current and previous iteration REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I have made self.likelihoods as a list of log-likelihood values from each iteration, this value should be increasing and should be converging.  2 consecutive iteration value can be compared to check if the difference is less than epsilon and if so can be considered as the converge point and stop further iteration.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: One value at a time representing combined likelihood of all the docs. So one iteration one element added to the list. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: likelihood should end up being a list of values (one value for each doc). might be easier to append just a list, instead of one value at a time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont think that is correct. Isnt likelihood defined across all the docs, instead of one value for each doc? that is where convergence is measured to compare successive iterations. 
THREAD: Expected outcome for starting point REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, you are correct. this is the output you should get when you have not implemented the tasks mentioned.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Yes, that looks right. also, you dont have to fill all the code at once, you can do little at a time, run the program again and see the changes (voc size and contents for example). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, did you also get a Failure status on Livelabs at first? Or was it a Success even when you first linked your repository to Livelabs? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn’t link till I was satisfied with my code on the local machine. That is I didn’t push the code through git till I saw the convergence for the sample file REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: print the log likelihood here , this should increase until it reaches local maxima. If you find this converging on sample data , it should work on the big data set ...

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The `rows sum to zero` is printed from the normalize function when there is an exception. Particularly when the some rows in the matrix that you are trying to normalize sum to zero, which will result in a divide by zero exception. Check your matrix to make sure no rows sum to zero  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/87f02aa4-dd60-4f75-bbb4-7809f4ee0efc/image.png)

THREAD: Second iteration always decreases likelihood value REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If this is for the test.txt file, your values are off ( should expect in the range of -17000s and then converge to -15000s). But then again can't really help without seeing how your E-step and M-Step are working! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've been staring at my E and M steps for awhile now so I was confident they were right but I'm calculating my topic_prob matrix via einsum with ```self.topic_prob = np.einsum("ij,jk->ijk", D, T)``` where D and T are doc_topic_probs and topic_word_probs. I've checked that the shape of topic prob is 1000,2,6 and then normalized every 2x6 matrix within. At this point I don't know what I couldve missed... My M step is pretty similar in that I use einsum but with term doc matrix and topic prob. All the resulting shapes match and I normalized after both einsums too. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you normalizing in E-step and M-step? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yup, normalized all 1000 2x6 matrices in E-step and topic_word_prob and document_topic_prob in M step REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: maybe be likelihood function? How are you doing that one? ( sorry there is only so much I can help with without looking at what you have!) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For that one I'm using matrix multiplication instead of for loops because that just seemed easier especially with the shapes.   I'm matrix multiplying document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob, then summing that result along axis=0, taking the log of that sum, and multiplying it by term_doc_matrix. Finally, I'm appending np.sum(likelihood) into corpus.likelihoods.  like so ``` likelihood = self.term_doc_matrix * np.log((np.sum(np.matmul(self.document_topic_prob,self.topic_word_prob), axis=0))) ```  I can't really grasp my head around how to do it with for loops so this is how i did it  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Look at post #1356, in there, at the bottom Amanda posted a screenshot of the equation hope that helps! ( no need for for loops for that one) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2bb65bca-463c-4017-bb1f-2de0de3b61be/image.png)  I am having the same problem like you, just the likelihood function, I think it has something to do with 2 summations over here. But I cant wrap my head around it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've summed across axis=1 to sum each word in V, then summed across axis=0 for each document in C so I really don't know what I'm missing from that formula tbh REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For E-step but I think you should be normalizing topic_word_prob as 2 1000x6 matrices instead of 1000 2x6 matrices.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you clarify more? I don't really understand how I could do that if the structure of topic_word_prob when printed is 1000 2x6 matrices. How would I transform 1000 2x6 into 2 1000x6 matrices freely like that  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So the shape of topic_word_prob is given as 1000x2x6 Each topic can be treated as a 1000x1x6 matrix.  To normalize we divide topic_word_prob by the sum of the topic matrixs.  What I had done to achieve that was sum topic_word_prob across axis = 1  Then divide topic_word_prob with the resulting matrix. ``` topic_word_prob / topic_word_prob.sum(axis = 1, keepdims = True) ```   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the problem is that you are multiplying a 1000by2 matrix (document_topic_prob) and a 2by6 matrix (topic_word_prob), which will result in a 1000by6 matrix. Using `np.sum(..., axis = 0)` on that matrix will sum all columns of the matrix, and result in  a 1by6 matrix.   To fix this issue, use `np.out()` to multiply doc/word on corresponding topic, and then sum them together. This way you will have a 1000by6 matrix.

Token expiry used to generate similar error afair. Check your token if expired renew the git token.. and then unlink the github account from livelabdata  and relink.. should be then fixed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If token is expired, then you can do these in detailed step: On your livelabdata delink all the linked accounts in levedatalab using the `Delete Linked Account` .. and try generating a new token in github and create a new linked account with the new api token.  Also, you can also make sure you followed all steps thoroughly step 3 onwards from the doc LiveDataLab setup.pdf that you can find in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I recently relinked my account since it's expired REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A few days ago, I found my token expired.

THREAD: MP3 build_term_doc_matrix REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: first of all there's no way to really check whether you're building the term_doc_matrix correctly if you're using the test.txt... like i said in my hints.. make a trivial example . it'll help you out. the jth index term is referring to the fact that if there are 5 documents and i have 3 unique vocabs... I will have a 5x3 matrix in where the jth term is associated with the vocab.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I get your point. From what you are saying , it should be 1000 * 7(unique words i.e. vocabulary) matrix, which is the transpose of what I have mentioned. But in this example , which word is j = 0? is it Chicago? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: depends on how you're building it . But yes it should be corresponding to the vocabulary list. You're in control when you construct that matrix... so whatever you want to do lol . you just need to create the mappings yourself  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: This is how you can visualize `term_doc_matrix` ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5515250c-bb6e-45d5-9b0c-5d9898f384fe/image.png)  where, doci is the i th document is documents array termj is the j th term in vocabulary array  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: think it's flipped P:  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: good catch in terms of i and j.. yes fixed it. 
THREAD: expectation_step() REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: These two posts gives a good explanation of the intermediate logic: #1420 #1429  if that helps you.  Also this, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089893/understanding-numpys-einsum   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: so what's really going on here isn't a traditional matrix multiplication per se... but basically for each document, we are generating a topic by word joint probability that is hidden per the E step of the EM step.   numpy einsum is really helpful for generating this joint probability  as ujjal pointed out and i've pointed out in the other posts . Read the examples in StackOverflow ! there's an example of generating a 3D array from two 2D arrays.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the other option is to use loops to generate this joint probability  
THREAD: Updating Z in M-Step REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: you're on the right path if you're using einsum in M step as well ! the term_doc_matrix is the c(w,d) so you have to use it with the Z(topic_prob) matrix. Recall what the M step is doing.    ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f4e61937-ad3c-467a-87ef-2558dba095d6/image.png)  notice how c(w,d) is in the p(w|z) and P(z|d) .   If you used einsum in step E , think about how you used those dimensions to map to each other now just do the reverse ! note that the dimensions for all these matrix all share three terms : #of topics, #of vocab, #of documents. These will help out . Good luck  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am currently using Z and D to update P(w|z) and Z and T to update P(z|d) but looking at the formula does that mean I can derive both P(w|z) and P(z|d) only using Z and c(w,d)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, in M-step, you simply just multiply term doc matrix  * topic prob (topic prob is what you calculated in E step). then you normalize over topics and words respectively.  when you use einsum, remember you are just updating the topic word prob and document topic prob. they should have the same dimensions as before REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do I normalize over topics and words respectively? I thought the normalize function normalizes based on input matrix, so wouldn't I only be able to normalize term doc matrix * topic prob by itself.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes after the multiplication it becomes a 2d array so you can normalize it by itself.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How would this product be used to calculate P(w|z) and P(z|d) then? I'm still unsure what I would be using einsum to map then.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: this product generated by einsum is the value unnormalized... the terms you're placing in einsum this time are term doc matrix and topic prob. Read carefully into the einsum documentation example on stackoverflow and look at the examples and think about it but reverse. Similar to how you can use that to upscale the dimensions, you can use it to scale down the dimensions.   note that einsum is totally optional and you can just implement this in for loops if you want to lol  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used einsum with term doc matrix and topic prob to calculate both P(w|z) and P(z|d) and then normalized each of those results. I got confused but the multiplication of the term doc matrix and topic prob is handled by einsum correct? I REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep  
THREAD: Error while normalizing the E-step REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: you can't normalize Z just straight out. How do you normalize a 3D array ? with just the normalize function. Think about what the normalized function is doing. It's adding the numbers along a row and normalizing per row. So if you need to normalize (Z) , think about how you can do that for a 3d array. Also think about what it represents as the Z matrix. Hint the dimensions will give you the clue here  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah I see. I didn't even think about what it meant to normalize a 3d matrix. Thanks.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lol no worries ... upvote would be helpful turns out this thing is like a bit of a game :P   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So the numerator of the function gives an array of size (1000x2x6), while the denominator creates an array of size(1000x6).   I'm confused with how this should be divided. Is the solution as simple as adding back a dimension to the denominator in order to allow element-wise division? This would create (1000x2x6)/(1000x1x6) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the way to think about this problem is not to think of numerator vs denominator but multiplication then normalization. So do your matrix mult however you want then just make sure you normalize it . Dimensions are important but also think about what traversing these dimensions would be like in python and what it means to normalize. Or more importantly when you're summing across "the x dimension" how does that work ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, it might be simpler to make a for-loop to normalize each row or column in this 3d matrix. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep also a totally viable way to do it as well  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Welp, I'm trying to do just that but it seems like the normalizer just returns the exact same number for every row of my 3D array. Any idea why that's happening? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i'm not sure how you have a row in a 3D array ? lol you have a submatrix in a 3d array. or are you talking about every submatrix being an exact same number ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: well, maybe I'm just understanding it wrong but for the z values for test.txt you're basically getting 1000 2x6 sub matrices right? One for each document.   It seems like the normalizer is giving me the exact same value for each 2x6 submatrix I normalize regardless of what the input is. So normalize(z_array[0, :, :]) and normalize(z_array[1, :, :]) give me the exact same numbers REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: then something is wrong lol and i'm not sure what you're calling in your function. Step through it and you can debug ! you can also just step through each item in a 3d array to get you the sub matrix  
THREAD: Corpus is not defined error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: do you have the Corpus class in your code along with the __init__(self, documents_path) function defined which creates the corpus? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes i have both REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you trying to instantiate (call) Corpus from another file or from console? If yes, then you would need to do something like this `from plsa import Corpus`  Also curious, are you using notebook or cli?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yea if you're using notebook to run through this , make sure run the line that defines the class first ^ before you run the main() REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The only reason is that it is not able to find the class definition before main runs. If you running it as a single file on console through Python command - there is no reason it should give you the error. 
THREAD: How does T and D correlate to the E step and M-step formulas on the slides? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: This is the general formula for EM algo... you're better off looking specifically at the PLSA implementation of it. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/133b718f-1912-4255-8f77-5e42e68fcf6d/image.png)  In here we can see that D is just the pi aspect of the function, and T is the p(theta) aspect of the formulas for E and M step... I.e for E step you need T and D and for M step you need Z generated from T and D + c(w,d)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the explanation! That makes a lot more sense! Is the denominator in the E-step the normalization function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yep you can use that  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do you use the normalize function, since it takes a 2d matrix as input (rather than 3d)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: To normalize the 3d matrix, you can make a for-loop to iterate through each row or column in your submatrix then normalize that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not sure if my implementation is correct or not, but in maximization_step(), I was normalizing topic_word_prob (T) and document_topic_prob (D), which are both 2d matrices.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: pretty much. To add to that : what is a 3d matrix actually ? if you're struggling to understand this... it's a list of matrices. (# of documents, # of topics, # of words) is the dimensions of this matrix. I.e for each document we have a joint probability matrix of topics and words which represent a joint probability. If you're struggling to understand this, can review some linear algebra cause I suspect this will come up a lot in other courses as well!  And it is a common theme I think throughout data science...  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Does that mean we can iterate through all the documents and just call the normalize function given to use (# of documents) times to normalize the 3d array? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes but understand what you're normalizing wrt and what the normalize function is normalizing wrt as well

(if you aren't sure you can print the version and make sure you are on the same platform and then possibly you can replicate the error on your local machine). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you check if you have any variables initialized to "None"? There are few variables initialized to None in Corpus __init__. Those variables should be updated in each iteration. If your implementation is correct, at the end of each iteration you should not have any NoneType variables in your code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, there are variables such as term_doc_matrix, document_topic_prob, topic_word_prob, and topic_prob initialized to None, but I have not implemented the methods yet that are supposed to update the variables. Just asking, is the autograder supposed to return an error if you only implement build_corpus and not the other methods?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: this exercise does not depend on python version (at least it did not for me) since there are no version dependent libraries. Nonetype usually comes from the use of an uninitialized variable. Please check if the functions are using any variable which is  set to 'None' in the template code provided. that should be your culprit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, when I added some dummy values to initialize_randomly(), it removed the error. Just asking, is it not possible to check incrementally to see if the methods are working or not. Do you only see if it is working if you implement all of the methods in plsa.py? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can. I mean till you implement at least the E step, you can try printing the values etc (for example, when I started, I could see the vocabulary, its size, total document etc) - the code given also spits out some values. When you implement only the E step, you can see at least that, but if it is "working" completely - that would need M step and calculate likelihood both.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I excluded the column.             for line in f:                 normalized_line = line[(line.index('\t') + 1):]                 normalized_line  = normalized_line .strip()                 normalized_line = normalized_line.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))                 self.documents.append(normalized_line.split(' '))  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank Jair, that's true, I should have used find() instead of index(). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, the livedatalab uses slightly different testing data format. for the code to remove the 1/0, try wrapping that in an if condition. you can also test on the DBLP.txt data to see if your code works without errors 
THREAD: Do we need return in plsa REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The function has no return, but on the function calculate_likelihood(self, number_of_topics):  you have to append to the self.likelihood of each interaction. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Do we need to return in calculate_likelihood? How about other methods? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Seems like we keep the changes into the class's members like: self.likelihoods REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You don't need to return anything in the plsa function. Just make sure you call the methods you wrote  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No, the method don't need to return, just load the self.likelihood[] with self.likelihood.append() for each interaction REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![log_lokelihood.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0d8804a5-e1a8-44ef-88f7-76e06c1e7d48/log_lokelihood.png) That is the formula that I used.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you need to keep on adding the model likelihoods to the self.likelihoods list. the grader probably taks the last two elements and calculates the delta which should be <= epsilon. 
THREAD: Where do we submit Project Proposal REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 7]: Submission Instructions is [here](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) also can be found in [Week9 Submission Page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/CjO6a/project-proposal-and-team-formation-submission-for-grading/step-1/submit/) - See the Instructions section in that page.  Below is the more detailed version. Please follow the order for not to miss any step.  **Google Signup Sheet [(Link)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwQW_q9AKCplRDQUhgXYIP9Kg0xRb_nRo0bbx1FeJ7I/edit#gid=0)** - By ALL Team members. Below are steps: 1. Make sure google signup sheet is updated with all the details in all columns 2. Please make sure `Theme Preference`, `Specific Topic` fields have valid data (and not TBD or blank)  **Github Fork [(Link)](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/CourseProject)**  - Only by Team Captain. Below are steps: 1. The team captain should be able to fork the [github repo](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/CourseProject). 3. Team captain should also add team members as collaborators on the fork repo 4. As per the submission [instruction](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) in week9, Github fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc.  4. The team captain should then finally paste the github fork link on the CMT submission page in the 'Abstract' field. (we also added the fork Github link inside the proposal document too).   **CMT Submission [(Link)](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CS410Expo2021/Submission/Index)** - Only by Team Captain. Below are steps: 1. Team Captain --> Open the CMT --> Crate Submission --> Select The track  2. The team captain should be able to add the link to the forked Github repository via the "Abstract" field. There is no need to upload any documents to CMT, just a link to the repository is needed. This way, the reviewers (other students) can look at your CMT submission abstract and follow the link to the repository, which contains all of your project information. [*Note: This is lates update by TA Kevin*] 2. Team captain should also add team members on the same Submission page.   3. During the submission process, there might be  a `Edit Conflicts of Interest` page, just ignore and continue by hitting the `Done` button.   4. Rest of the team members doesn't have to do anything on CMT. But they need to have accounts in CMT using the illinois email address. 5. After the submission is complete, all the team members for that team should be able to see/access the submission.     **Coursera Submission [(Link)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/CjO6a/project-proposal-and-team-formation-submission-for-grading)** - By ALL Team members. Below are steps: 1. Go to coursera page  `Project Proposal and Team Formation Submission for Grading` which is located here:  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/irt/CjO6a/project-proposal-and-team-formation-submission-for-grading 2. All team members should hit the `Submit` button   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Do we also need to upload it to github? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our team captain forked the github repo and then uploaded there too.   As per the submission [instructions](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) in week9, Github fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc. (So I would assume submit proposals both on CMT and Github fork)  What is also needed though is to add the fork repo link in the project proposal document. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since the project proposal document is uploaded on CMT, why do we need to upload the proposal document to a public GitHub repo? I am not comfortable sharing my proposal document to the public. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Two place they told two things...  In the Repo [Readme](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/CourseProject): Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview/Week 9 Activities.  But.... As per the submission [instructions](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/UQRdRid1QDiEXUYndXA4sQ_1ec9c66d6c4f42ec8087f821db56ccf1_course_project_cmt_instructions.docx?Expires=1635120000&Signature=OL8JZ3m0k60bFVIUWjIXzWWoIBwUH~YqopjOEcKyg9m0VhcDEFzw2st5S6z1cMYWLOGDIh0Dw17N6c5Y8EVPuIDmUDfbFcSlYfQtsdlZkpSJII1KjN8uZm8Ax464GwESAykW7VH8oDiLHBMCN9PliC00-dRlaUPl7aAXKDREZuo_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) in week9, Github fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc. (So I would assume submit proposals both on CMT and Github fork) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: TAs should pay you for all the work you are doing for them :-D. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont want everyone to go through all the hurdles my team went through in last two days figuring out the best way for submission. lol REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I saw now the place to fold the document of CMT REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I see that you edited your reply, so will add that I am NOT comfortable sharing the project reports and presentations on public platforms (code is fine). The TAs should give us an option to submit privately, e.g., by giving access only to those who need to have access (e.g., instructor, TAs, and peer-reviewers). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi everyone,  I apologize for not making the instructions more clear. All project material should be uploaded to the forked Github repository. Then, the link to the forked Github repository is submitted to CMT, via the "Abstract" field. There is no need to upload any documents to CMT, just a link to the repository is needed. This way, the reviewers (other students) can look at your CMT submission abstract and follow the link to the repository, which contains all of your project information.     And thanks to Ujjal for giving a great summary. One quick notes about the post:  1. In "CMT Submission", point 4, the rest of the team members should create CMT accounts, but they do not need to do anything regarding the submission.  Best, Kevin REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Si, I figured out and double checked what was mentioned in the submission instructions document and repo README both places. I have added all sources of information too.    I see TA Kevin also replied in this post with same thoughts,  However, you can also send a private post to the instructors mentioning your concern and they can best advice.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Kevin. I updated point#4 on CMT to match what you just mentioned above.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I understand, but I feel it would be more fair to the person you are replying to if you would create a new post instead of editing the original post. The person to who you are replying does not get notified or has a track history about such edits and his/her original reply to your post might not be relevant anymore...  Regarding the second part, that wasn't addressed to you directly. I understand that you are not in charge. I just shared my point of view. Perhaps others feel the same way. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Oh. I thought edits are being notified to whom I am replyig to. Seems that it isn't. :(  (I had to edit the post few times to match all latest updates and sorry for the inconvenience my friend).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our group ended up uploading the proposal pdf to both Github and CMT as a submission file, since the instructions weren't clear at all. It seems there's been a decent amount of confusion in general about tasks related to this course. 
THREAD: topic_word_prob REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: topic_word_prob is a matrix of p(word | topic), in other words, what is the probability that a word belongs to a topic if my understanding is correct. A little thing I found out is that if you look at the given "initialize_uniformly" function, you can see the dimensions for the arrays they use when testing, which will be the same as you will need.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: This matrix represent each word's probability in each topic, with dimension (k = #of topic, v = #of vocabulary). 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 9, Question 2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here the constraint is that both the terms are drawn from "same" topic model. So :  $$p(w_1,w_2) = p(\theta_1).p(w_1| \theta_1).p(w_2|\theta_1) +  p(\theta_2).p(w_1| \theta_2).p(w_2|\theta_2)$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Pl ignore, I deleted the post. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Imagine you have single word with probability A in two topics with Prob X and Y. then you do:  A*X + A*Y  Now there are two words with prob A and B. The catch here is to think BOTH the words as a single group (since they have to come from the same topic model) - hence combined probability of them as a group would be A*B (irrespective of the topic).  Including topic prob in this eq: A * B * X + A * B * Y  Hope that helps. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In reply to your comment: "All the words in the document are generated based on the chosen language model" which means we supposed that every word in the document is generated in one language model.  For instance, all from the background model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This is explained in the course text as well.  The course text says "the mixture model can be regarded as a single word distribution defined in a somewhat complicated way"  Start with the last paragraph on page 348 and continue onto page 349. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: is this from a book? Can you point me to it? I have been looking mainly at videos only. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: also, let me point out :-) that the prof specifically stressed that the lectures should be enough. not that I am not against reading the book. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is from Professor Cheng's own text book.  You can download it from the UIUC library for free.  This is from the Syllabus page of Week 1:   There is not a required textbook for this course, but there are several optional readings suggested in each week's overview page. All readings listed in the weekly overview pages are optional and are primarily from the following textbook:  Zhai, C. & Massung, S. (2016). Text data management and analysis: A practical introduction to information retrieval and text mining. ACM Book Series. Morgan & Claypool Publishers. 
THREAD: E-Step Equation Explanation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are normalizing the value (probability) that was calculated in numerator, by dividing with the sum of probabilities over all topics.  So each term in the summation is the same kind of probability, as calculated in numerator. But in numerator it is for a specific topic 'j'. In denominator, it is the sum of such a probability for all the topics (1,...k), conditioned on the given document "d" and word "w".  So ensures that $$\sum_k{p(z_{d,w} = k)} = 1$$ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: The general understanding of this p is the probability of word w is generated from a topic k among a set of topics. For this formula, the numerator is the probability of word w generated from topic k, the denominator the sum of probabilities that word w is generated from different topics. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There is one thing may be confusing about p(z d,w=k) is that when I tried to calculate this p, I thought the words that are not in the document should be zero. However, the truth is p(z d,w=k) will store the probability for every vocabulary word for every document, because in the M-step, the c(w,d) will make the probability of words not in this document zero. And this is why the dimension of p(z d,w=k)  is (n = # of docs, k = # of topics, v = # of vocabulary). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you, your explanation helped saved quite some time for me. 
THREAD: How many parameters in Lambda REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we also need to consider the degrees of freedom:  - $$p(w_1|\theta_1) + ... +  p(w_V|\theta_1)$$) = 1 , per topic model $$\theta_i$$  - $$\pi_{11} + \pi_{12} + ... + \pi_{1k}$$ = 1, per document  I suppose these constraints will reduce the DF and total number of model parameters. But I may not be thinking it right. 
THREAD: Vocabulary for test.txt 6 or 8 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. 0 and 1 are for visual testing purposes only and should be excluded from vocabulary.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Great thank you :D REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No. Those 0 and 1 will help the EM algorithm converge faster. Think about the first 100 documents as a supervised learning problem. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could you please elaborate a little more? Thanks. 
THREAD: Conflict of Interest? Project Proposal on CMT REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It is like a conflict management system between author and reviewer. We have ignored it.  You can hit Done and you can always come back see your submission list and edit any conflict on interest from there too. So it is always safe to ignore conflict at the time of submission and just hit the Done button for submission (no doubt there).  I think even if you dont hit Done button in conflict page your proposal is still submitted. The conflict page is something where your action is not mandatory.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b4e5f84d-cf43-44f1-8451-ef5d8dc890ad/image.png)  ===============  You will find more details here: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/docs/help/chair/conflicts.html#individual-based-conflict-management  
THREAD: MP3 Grade Not Transferring to Coursera REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am having this exact same issue, I just asked about it in office hour and was advised to message Kevin Ros about it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Did you use the Week7 MP3 `Open Tool` button to login into livelabdata instance? If not logout from livelabdata and try login using the `Open Tool` button from here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/d7yDq/mp3 and then resubmit the assignment once again.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/0066e477-f3cd-4f4e-8c1a-32413570bf75/image.png)    Also see #1363      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you able to see your leadership score as 1? I am having the same issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same question, I do see leadership score 1. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As long as you get 1 point from the leadership part, I think you will be fine. Just remember to seek help in office hours. You will get your point back : ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Had the similar issue. Make sure to initiate MP3 from week 7 Open tool button. Might need to scroll down on the page to see the button. Once you open Livedata Lab from there, push the changes again on github to reflect score on both coursera and livedata lab. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'm also having the same issue. Does it take longer for the grade to update on Coursera for this MP? I uploaded my code and passed on LiveDataLab but the grade has not updated yet. It's been nearly an hour.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #1363 This issues should have been resoled. Anything pending here? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Anyone experiencing this issue, mine resolved after I printed maximum likelihood after each iteration. 
THREAD: MP3 Do i need to explicitly call expectation maximization and calculate likelihood function in plsa? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, call them in the plsa function. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have to call them on `plsa(...)` function.    Autograder wont call your main function. The steps you see in `main()` function, autograder will only call those. The dataset file autograder will use might be different.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You must call expectation, maximization, and likelihood functions in plsa 
THREAD: Issues with LiveData Lab REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am having the same issue. Livedata status is success but score is 0. Not sure if it is a problem with livedata or with my code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Few things you can try:  1. Did you use the Week7 MP3 `Open Tool` button to login into livelabdata instance? If not try doing that from here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/d7yDq/mp3  2. In the first function called `build_corpus` print a test string and then put `exit(1)` to see atleast your print is getting printed or not. Your submission should fail too.   3. Would be nice to see if your github token didn't expire although generally livelabdata displays a different error message for token expiry.   4. Clear cache/cookies  logout. Open Livelabdata using `Open Tool` link and try submit again.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Ujjal,  I donot see any  Open Tool button  for MP3. Can you help me point to that? Also i was able to see logs for submission attempt 7 and the print statements are coming through.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/d7yDq/mp3  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/77f286a9-a7c2-4f4d-99d5-9a7a82cc53c2/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Jatin ,  Once I logged in to livedata instance through open tool, the submission status got updated.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks a lot Ujjal. I missed the Open Tool button.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Supriya - I did the same but still having same issue. Also in logs total 4000 iterations are running. Is the iteration no same for you.Wondering if i missing something in code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My score is not visible via Coursera as well. I have tried all the "solutions" but none of those work. I gave up on this working a while ago. I just hope that I am not penalized for not having my scored visible on Coursera. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If it is running for 4000 iterations, then there is a problem in the code. Few things you should check  1. Use test.txt file to verify your implementation. The first 100 documents with the labels are key to verify your code.  2. You can break your iterations when the log-likelihood doesn't change much. You should use "epsilon" as the threshold.   3. If your implementation is correct, you should see the topic probabilities of the documents moving towards 1 or 0 in each iteration. Once the iterations are stopped, inspect the topic probabilities of the documents for the first 100 documents and make sure they match the labels in test.txt (i.e For all the documents with 1s should have a probability close to 1 and for all the documents with 0s should have probability close to 0 or vice-versa because of the random nature of the topics.)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks Yogeswara. I was using the wrong matrix for calculation which was resulting in 4000 iteration.  I debug my code and fix the issue. 
THREAD: Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If there's nothing on that line, I would probably try deleting that line and copy/pasting all your code into a text file and back into the editor, just in case weird formatting stuff caused the issue.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The @ sign, which is an alias for np.dot(..), caused this issue for me. When I replaced the @'s with np.dot(..)'s this error went away. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was helpful, thanks! 
THREAD: Log likelihood decreasing (instead of increasing) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How did you calculate the likelyhood? You need to multiply each log by the term count before calculating the sum. 
THREAD: Array Dimensionality Reduction REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yeah that sounds correct! 
THREAD: Execute Shell Error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you post the rest of the error log? It usually has helpful info (such as #1268) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just uploaded it  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When do you use list.appended? Did you mean to put list.append? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ohh you are right.  I fixed that error and now I'm getting an error about M-step. Does that mean my E-step works fine? ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-22%20at%202.45.10%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fbb1481c-c905-476e-8c7a-64915286531f/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-22%20at%202.45.10%20PM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It looks like the matrix multiplication is wrong in the M step, are you doing M * N (where M and N are matrices)? If so, I'd look into using numpy for matrix multiplication. If you look up the operand broadcast error, there are many articles about why that happens/how to fix it. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried using @ instead of * but I think it gave me a syntax error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The first error line is ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3b718b2a-3dcc-4a6b-b898-016c0ae3af8e/image.png)   Update your code and replace `.appended()` with `.append()`. I believe that is the first issue to start with. 
THREAD: MP3 calculate likelihood REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The log likelihood can be calculated using this equation from the slides. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4fd26771-cd76-42f2-b4f8-05c9f4235b31/image.png) Remember that lambda_b is 0, so it simplifies a bit REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Your basic idea is correct. Just the log part should the log of sum of multiple of document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob. Like: log(sum(document_topic_prob * topic_word_prob)), this is also a matrix. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So if doc topic probability and topic word prob is 3by3 matrix, multiplication these 2 will give 3by3 matrix. How i need to sum it? Sorry for asking this. MP3 blew my mind. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can refer to np.sum(axis=0) which sum vertically and np.sum(axis=1) which sum horizontally. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using below to calculate likelihood in MP3. Any pointers if this the correct way?  ``` self.likelihood = np.log(np.sum(np.matmul(self.document_topic_prob,self.topic_word_prob),axis=0)) self.likelihoods.append(self.likelihood) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you're missing the word count component of the log ... see below  
THREAD: How to get a 3d numpy array? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The E-step involves updating P(z | w, d), which corresponds to self.topic_prob in the constructor. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: The self.topic_prob is a 3d array. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you can not do the simple matrix multiplication here. Maybe you should go back and check the slides again. Seeking help from the instructors may be a good choice at this point considering your question is a little bit complex.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: You can use np.einsum() to create the 3d numpy array. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32117340/multiplying-two-2d-numpy-arrays-to-a-3d-array  or loop through the topics to perform a series of 2d array dot products. 
THREAD: PLSA E-Step & M-Step denominator REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: There is a Normalize function given in the script.... Refer the initalize_Ones() funtion which uses it for example.  It basically applies the summation to "numerator" and returns numerator / summation of numerator REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought that function was just normalizing values within a matrix row but don't we need to do (D * T)/sigma (D * T) . We would need to write our own logic for this part and not re-use the normalize function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you see the calculation of the normalize function. you will see that that is what it is doing for you.  ``` row_sums = input_matrix.sum(axis=1)     try:         assert (np.count_nonzero(row_sums)==np.shape(row_sums)[0]) # no row should sum to zero     except Exception:         raise Exception("Error while normalizing. Row(s) sum to zero")     new_matrix = input_matrix / row_sums[:, np.newaxis]     return new_matrix ``` 
THREAD: Debugging MP3 locally + through submission REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I think so 2. I would recommend writing your own print statements to check the earlier methods first, but I think the autograder just tests plsa? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 1. Yes, we will use test.txt for local debugging and result verification, and for the first 100 documents in test.txt, the label of "0" or "1" should be removed before adding the document to corpus.  2. To validate a subset of the implementation, I would suggest doing the validation and debugging locally on "test.txt", as the corpus and vocabulary sizes are much smaller and the topic of the first 100 documents are clearly labelled for easier verification.   FYI, I tried to run the program locally on DBLP and found the following: Vocabulary size:30140, Number of documents:10835 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes it is for testing purposes only and also for manual debugging. You can create a copy of `test.txt` and remove those 0 and 1 too.  2. Since you have privilege of submitting unlimited times, anything you want to check with the autograder you can add print statements and run in autograder. But developing it locally will be much faster. In autograder submission, you can see your prints in the console output section. 
THREAD: MP3 Grading question REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I got mine to pass autograder by print max(self.likehoods) once the algo is completed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In the `main` function you can use `data/test.txt` (lighter) dataset or `data/DBLP.txt` (heavier) datasets.  The autograder will call the class with its own test dataset that is not shared with us.  The `main` section is for our testing and execution purpose only. Auto grader has its own dataset.    yes, if you get 1 on leaderboard that mean you pass. But also make sure in Grades section of coursera that you received grade for MP3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3e6512e2-4589-4f60-bb49-c1a645eb8c6c/image.png)   
THREAD: MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is used to check your likehood converge or not. If you are not sure, check the mathematics limit concept.  Basically, your EM iteration stops when n meet the maximum limit, or the diff is less than epsilon  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Every iteration improves your likelihood a little bit. When the improvement is so small (smaller than epsilon), you would like to stop running the algorithm and take the current best model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Let us say that if you have a list storing likelihood for each iteration. The list is like [l1,l2,l3,...,l27,l28,l29]. Normally the gap between the likelihood(like l2-l1, l3-l2, l4-l3) will get smaller and smaller. For example, if you found l28-l27 > epsilon but l29 - l28 < epsilon(the first time the gap is less than epsilon) , that is the time to stop your iteration(since the improvement is so small) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: epsilon is used as a threshold for likelihood delta for each iteration. once the delta is smaller than epsilon, your algo should exit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Each step of EM will improve the likelihood. At one point the improvement between step n and step n+1 will be negligible. Negligible in our case means the likelihood(n+1) - likelihood (n) < epsilon.

I went straight for the matrix operations which was probably not a great idea. It took me quite a while to translate the formulas into matrix operations. What helped me was to draw the matrixes on paper, fill them in with a few values, and work through the matrix operations by hand to make sure they were computing the formulas accurately.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My approach is to actually match the matrix operation output to the example in lecture 9.5.  The lecture example on 1st iteration can be thought of as 2 topic model.  The difference is the example doesn't modify the document-topic probability (our MP3 does).  This approach can help give assertion to E-Step, M-Step(word-topic probability), and log-likelihood.  an example file to generate the same starting point as lecture 9.5: ``` The The The The Paper Paper Text Text Text Text Mining Mining ``` Hope this helps :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'm feeling like I'm about to give up, this lab is a doozy...

THREAD: should the first 100 documents used as test data  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: That's a really good question. From what I can tell, the first 100 documents in test.txt were present so that we had a very clear way to differentiate the two topics and debug/test our code. Ie. you'd know that as you start going through the EM iterations on text.txt docs, you should be seeing p(z|D)s that approach 0 or 1 pretty well for the two z's, since we know that the first 100 documents are generated by only one topic.  I think this is a bit different from having test and training data in the traditional supervised machine learning sense, for a couple of potential reasons:  -  If you were to talk about test and training data in the more traditional supervised ML sense, you'd need to have a dataset that is completely labeled (i.e. to train your model, and to then test its performance on a labeled dataset), which wouldn't be the case here as you might consider only the first 100 rows as labeled.  - In the real world, I imagine you'd not normally have previous knowledge of the Z's (topics) to "label" your dataset. Instead, with PLSA, you're assuming that there are X topics in your data, and you let the EM algorithm try to find the best parameters to increase overall system likelihood (this being an optimization problem).  - The closest approach to ML I can see PLSA as is perhaps an unsupervised classification task, for which you don't need to split your data into test and training data, i.e. because the task is unsupervised, you don't have labels to test your data against (caveat: this of course depends on ML approach, and there are times when you might still want to have a test/train split in your data even for unsupervised tasks -- see a couple of discussions on this on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31673388/is-train-test-split-in-unsupervised-learning-necessary-useful), [stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/387326/unsupervised-learning-train-test-division), and [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-test-set-required-for-the-unsupervised-learning)). 
THREAD: initialize_randomly() REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: When you say scalar values, do you mean just one value for each instead of using a matrix? Since there are multiple documents, words, and topics, matrices are needed to keep track of all the probabilities. I'd suggest reading the lecture slides again and looking over the explanation in the git repo.   And about where to fill in the values, you can just use the np random function to get a matrix, and then normalize so the values sum to 1.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: (from the README)  *D (documents by topics): this is the set of parameters modeling the coverage of topics in each document,          which we denoted by pij's. Each element is the probability of a particular topic is covered in a particular document.*  I believe this is what you're referring to? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I found it very helpful to write down the dimensions of the given matrices, because it helped with visualizing what each matrix is supposed to represent. You can take a look at the function initialize_uniformly (which is given to us at the beginning) for hints on what some of the dimensions should be. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Why to do:  for your e-step, you need $$pi_{d,j}$$(storing in document_topic_prob matrix) and p(w| $$theta_j$$) (storing in topic_word_prob) to compute p($$z_{d,w}$$ = j), so you need to initialize values in two matrics.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/11deb3b2-4f17-4318-9e78-dbb3e3a1fdc4/image.png)      How to do:  One of the easiest way to determine the dimension of the two matrices: referring to the below completed function initialize_uniformly(). The two functions are almost the same. The only difference is that initialize_randomly() filling matrices with random values and initialize_uniformly() filling matrices with ones( and then normalized)

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, your assumption is correct . Consider this as an array of 3 dimention [document, topic, word], in your case the topic probablity would be [5,3,8] , remember pi is dependent on document here unlike single topic and background model ...  
THREAD: P(z | d) and P(w | z) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think P(z | d) -which I think is the same as the pi sub djs from lectures- is the document topic probability for a document. A document can be linked/covered by multiple Z's, and adding all Z's over a document would give you an overall probability of 1 (100%). In your example, what would need to be truth is that:  p(z1 | D1) + p(z2 | D1) + p(z3 | D1) = 1 p(z1 | D2) + p(z2 | D2) + p(z3 | D2) = 1 p(z1 | D3) + p(z2 | D3) + p(z3 | D3) = 1 p(z1 | D4) + p(z2 | D4) + p(z3 | D4) = 1  (I'm calling z1, z2, and z3 the 3 topics you mentioned)  From the lecture:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/edf85050-185d-4de0-aaca-0dc191635271/image.png)  On the other hand, P(w | z) is the probability that a word comes from a topic,  and here what would need to be truth is that, if you were saying that man and boy come from the same topic -let's call it z1- then:  P (man | z1) + P (boy | z1) = 1 (similar to above), see:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/c0fe237e-196f-4a81-bde6-0128d0133fa2/image.png)  I hope that helps! I think the main thing to realize is that many topics can be linked to a single document, and that over the same topic, when adding each individual word probability, they should add up to 100%.

THREAD: number_of_topics REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't use number_of_topics parameter in both two functions you mentioned, and passed the autograder. Using number_of_topics parameter seems to be optional. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was also confused on this, since I also needed number_of_topics in functions where it wasn't passed in directly. I don't think it matters too much if you use number_of_topics vs. self.topic_prob, I used both throughout functions and passed the autograder REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The number_of_topics parameter should be the same value you get from the dimension of self.topic_prob, so it shouldn't matter which you use. 
THREAD: MP3. Takes too long to build term-document matrix REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You could make sure your code doesn't do any redundant calculations?

I don't suppose you would be able to provide some help into how you were able to pass? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I reviewed my code several times, for the calculation for each matrix, and found several errors in my formula. For example, in my formula of calculating the likelihoods, I used document_topic_prob * topic_prob which should be document_topic_prob * word_topic_prob. There are so many matrics in it and it's very easy to bog up. As long as you can run success, you're on the right track and only need to debug you codes. 
THREAD: Week9 Pratice Quiz 6 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: EM algorithm guarantees local maxima, not global maxima i.e it depends on where you initialise . You might be lucky to hit global maxima in case you initialise the EM algorithm which is close to global maxima   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Abhijit is right. yes the algo finds the maximum point - closest to it (local). so depending on the initialization, you may hit a different maxima. and hence the answer is false. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, Abhijit. I got the point now. So, is it possible to get the maximum point of global? If the answer is 'no', we must try different initializations for finding the 'best' point as we can? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's why you have the random initialisation on MP3 by default, run it few number of times and you might hit the bulls eye :)   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you.

THREAD: MP3- Build vocabulary construct list of unique word REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: python supports constructing sets REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Or you can construct a list and use ```not in``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Start putting the tokens in a set() - it guarantees uniqueness REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: it depends on the context/group. in your house your name might be unique, but probably not in your school. that "context" usually in programming languages is modelled in a (mathematical) structure called the set. when you say does python has a function to find the unique word, you have to say which group/context too. Set is such a group and most of the programming languages simply overwrite (thus maintaining a single instance) if the element/word already exists within that data structure. it also means that in a set, you cant keep track of the other properties- for example "counts" of the word.  if you do want to maintain other attributes of the group (like count for every word), you can use a map or dictionary (key->value pairs) too - where the keys are guaranteed to be unique, and values could be duplicated. I apologize, this answer is probably much more than what you asked for. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hint:  Numpy does this in a single function (try your best guess)...  It takes numpy array as an argument. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Numpy worked well for me to quickly identify unique words, so you may want to look into that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: use a set() data structure :)

THREAD: MP3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See #1034 also  It is expected for you to implement EM algo. The code architecture is there. You need to implement several functions.  To do this, you need to really understand the EM also, like how to init variables, how to calc E, to calc M ....  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Make sure you write the functions properly since the grader seems to call these functions to validate your logic . plsa function also needs to modify to call E, M and log liklihood steps  
THREAD: What's the dimension of likelihood in MP3? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The likelihood should be of one dimension at last. You will get a double number, and will converges to a fixed value. When it becomes stable (see one parameter delta like 0.001) , the iteration is supposed to stop. Or you have looped enough n times depends on which condition meets first. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You get the likelihood of each word in each document, and sum then to get the likelihood of each document in total, and finally sum all to get one value. You may refer the formula in Slide 7 below. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%209.25.05%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b916c6f3-aa91-452f-801b-a1650107c4e6/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%209.25.05%20PM.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since lamda-b is 0 as per MP3, your log likelihood function is only ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/e6fcf467-5c5f-4f24-a972-cf827944b205/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I finally passed the auto-grader. So for my MP3, the self.likelihoods = [ ] is a list where I appended the likelihoods of each document (I calculated the likelihood for each doc first), the final likelihood which we used to compare in the iteration is only one variable (the collection likelihood which is the sum of likelihoods of all docs). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you clarify this a bit? Do you mean that you updated self.likelihoods at each step so that self.likelihoods was a dxn matrix (d = # of docs, n = # of iterations)? I'm trying to figure out why my code doesn't pass the autograder. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I calculated the likelihood of each document. The likelihood is just a double number for each document, I stored them in the self.liklihoods (one dimension, d = # of docs). At last, just sum up to get the final likelihood for the whole collection. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What about the iterations? My impression is that for each iteration, we should produce a single log-likelihood value. At the end of all the iterations, our self.likelihoods should be a basic array of size max_iterations. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For each iteration, we calculate the "new" likelihood and compare that to the "current_likelihood". self.likelihoods an array of length # docs.  For the purpose of comparison, all elements of self.likelihood should get summed up (storing the resulting sum for the next iteration if the likelihood is still improving) 
THREAD: How many words should our project proposal be?

THREAD: Toolkits for Medical Text Analytics 
THREAD: Practice quiz 9, question 8 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: $\lambda_B$ represents the "percentage of background words (known)" as per (top left of) slide 6 of the pdf file for lecture 9-7. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry I don't catch your point. If it is known, why the given answer says that it is learnt, not fixed? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't know the answer to that question. I am guessing that known=can be learned. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The answer is shown in the first figure. If it is learnt, I think the value should keep changing during the E-step or M-step, rather than fixed. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: $$\lambda_B$$ is fixed and determined by the user, as stated in the slides. In the option B, 'the probability of background', however, is not $$\lambda_B$$, it is $$p(w|\theta_B)$$. It indicates the probability of a specific word is from the background. The get $$p(w|\theta_B)$$, a random value is assumed at the initial step, and the EM algorithm is used to iteratively solve (learn) the value of $$p(w|\theta_B)$$. Eventually the algorithm output converges and the estimation of $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ is obtained/learned.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! I agree with you that the 'probability of a of background' is $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ rather than $$\lambda_B$$. But in the third figure, it seems that $$p(w|\theta_B)$$ is fixed in E-step and M-step as well. How can it be learnt? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, I think I messed up. The probability of background should be $$p(z_{d,w}=B)$$.  ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%203.34.09%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/72b95ce6-f377-44f4-ac36-f4c65dc011d2/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%203.34.09%20PM.png) This one is updated in E step.

THREAD: Time out error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It appears that your program got stuck in the ```plsa```  method between ```print ("EM iteration begins...")``` and ```self.initialize```.   You may want to check 1) build term-doc matrix and 2) Create the counter arrays. Maybe there is a loop that does not end?   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]:  You may print something per EM loop to know what is ongoing.   Also, you need to ensure the likelihood can converge.  Maybe this is the reason that your algo loops too many times 
THREAD: Do we still need to normalize if intialize prob matrix between [0,1)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, normalize is to ensure the sum of all elements in a row equals to one. This is to satisfy the constrains of the optimization, as shown in the equations below. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.05.41%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/32938f57-cd9a-4f91-9f3a-15674617d9f1/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.05.41%20AM.png)  Randomize the elements to between [0,1) does not guarantee that they satisfy the constrains.

THREAD: Week 9 Likelihood Function (Unigram Model) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since the second line is symmetric across all the w_i (i=1..M) values, I am guessing that the word positions are irrelevant. I do not know why theta_i = p(w_i | theta) in the last line. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Assume a document is 'this and and'. Then  The probability that the first word is 'this' equals $$p('this'|\theta)$$.  $$p(d|\theta)=p('this'|\theta)p('and'|\theta)p('and'|\theta)$$ $$=p('this'|\theta)p('and'|\theta)^2$$  This example explains the 2nd line and the first part of the 3rd line. For the latter part of the 3rd line, it is a definition, just in this slide above this equation. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.23.26%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/10fef066-83ac-407d-904e-e7ccc38c52a8/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-20%20at%2010.23.26%20AM.png)

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought that's what w' refers to as well, but now I'm not so sure. The sum in the denominator is over "w' ϵ V", which looks like it means "all words in the vocabulary". Can an instructor tell us for sure?

THREAD: Submission in author console REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For the team formation stage, you just need a team & idea for a topic! The actual proposal is due next week I believe REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Well, it says "Only the group leader needs to enter the project topic. However, every student needs to enter all other details. This needs to be completed before the proposal submission, i.e. before Oct, 24 to facilitate grading. "  So to answer OP's question, it is Yes and you have time until 24th Oct.

Most of the cases, I am seeing all the teammate filling all the columns.  I also sent a private post to the instructors for clarification but haven't heard back anything yet. I can update if I hear anything back.

But I recommend filling all the columns for safety. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Regarding the Google Sheet, just got a response from the Instructor. Below is the response as is I received:   *It is only necessary for the team lead to enter the project track and project topic, as long as the project name is consistent across all team members. Also, there is no harm in everyone filling out all of the fields, as long as the information is consistent across all team members.* 
THREAD: Lecture 8.7 generative model for text mining REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think that seems similar to my understanding! I understood it as:  1. Design a model that can potentially "generate" the piece of text.  2. Change various parameters of the model. For each possible variation, check how likely is it that the variation could generate the piece of text.  3. The variation with the highest probability is the one that we're looking for 
THREAD: MP3 grader says invalid syntax but code runs locally REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It was due the to the grader running an outdated version of numpy. Please use np.matmul everyone. I would request  the course staff to update the numpy version being run on the autograder. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the reason being they have Python3.6 version running on their end (the same python version that were used for MP1 and MP2). And yes, they can have earlier numpy version too cause the auto grader environment might not have been updated and uses a numpy that came during the python3.6. The versions can be printed to confirm that.  We might have to maintain the same environment what the autograder runs (both python,  numpy etc).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No they do not. the operator belongs to numpy and can only be solved by updating numpy. It runs very well on python 3.5, 3.6, and other python versions if the correct version of numpy is used which can be updated with a single command on the server with pip. Python version does not matter AT ALL in numpy operations as long as the numpy version supports it. @everyone it is the numpy version, not the python version that is causing the issue. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I do agree with you. In my original statement I do meant same thing you did (maybe the words appeared to mean different and I rephrased it).. What I meant is if we maintain same python, numpy and other external packages versions what the autograder runs, we might run into less issues. Thank you   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I believe the log indicates an older version of numpy running: ![SubmissionLog.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/861225cb-f5ca-4be6-b513-9905e9a6107a/SubmissionLog.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, maybe we need to check the old NumPy document to finish this project.

So you are not alone. :)   After week9, for any change. I would recommend taking Instructor's confirmation.

You need to finish the proposal and submit by the end of this week, where you should include your team details REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So, it's today to form a team and let the instructors know of the same and the end of this week to submit the 1-pager that answers these questions. "In your proposal, please answer the following questions:  What are the names and NetIDs of all your team members?   Who is the captain? The captain will have more administrative duties than team members.  What is your free topic? Please give a detailed description.   What is the task? Why is it important or interesting?   What is your planned approach? What tools, systems or datasets are involved?   What is the expected outcome? How are you going to evaluate your work?  Which programming language do you plan to use?

THREAD: References for Tech review REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can search in search engine and pick references that you may find interesting. The references links provided for some of the topics in the topic list i believe is just a starting point. But there isn't any restriction that one cannot see other reference link. Rather you may find some other link as more relevant for your review than even the one mentioned in topic list.   You can also look through research paper and journal.   I have topic that has no references too and I picked few resources as references from search engine search results, few published papers etc.  You just have to do the proper citations for the ones you referred.

I see Sentiment Analysis as one of the previous project in here: https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/channel/CS+410+Spring+2019/112201961. Make sure you do proper citation if you plan to refer anything from it.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A related discussion is here: #640, which is on the tools aspect of the project. So, it seems like we can use the tools that are readily available but there is no mention of data use. Detailed information on the software part is given here https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview "You should try to reuse any existing tools as much as possible so as to minimize the amount of work without sacrificing your goal."    I do not see anything on 'data' in the above link other than an aside ["Completion of a functioning software is emphasized also due to the potential dependency between multiple projects when they are all contributing to a larger project (e.g., one team may produce a crawler to crawl data for use by another team to build a search engine)"] or ["Leaderboard Competition: You can choose to create a new dataset for a competition"] here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubzdWekH2WLzft-IaSnkYflKrR7DqW-X7WsWiG30loI/edit#heading=h.tbmrctseuh6t

You may need to really calc one time, so you can really know. it is not easy to get it one time.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Gah -- my original answer was wrong.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have options between external webcam, phone camera, mirror. Most of the time they dont ask anything. But there have been instances they ask for it. Depends on proctor and also the room. Try to sit in room that has only one door and well lit. If you planning to use a laptop, try to face the laptop webcam towards the door and likely they wont ask for anything. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I did the exam on Monday.

I've had issues in previous classes with proctors not being able to type in the correct password/set up taking 30 min-1 hour. If you really want to do it though, you could check if 9:50 is even an available time slot in ProctorU REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: After 10pm deadline the exam on coursea will be most likely locked and you won't be able to submit it if you're still working on it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: If you run into issues that would be bad. Avoid the borderline and give yourself the unexpected troubleshooting window too. Many classmates spent upto 60 mins in the setup process.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it's fair to say that it's not worth it from a risk-benefit analysis perspective.   The relatively little gain through an extra hour or two of studying is not worth the dire consequence of failing to complete the exam -- imagine how much stress and regret you would feel.  Like the others said, with proctoru, it's not so rare to encounter issues/delays.  So it would be wise to leave some slack time.   Good luck!

So each node(among N nodes) will point to every other node and will have all other nodes pointing to itself. This means the transition matrix will be a uniform matrix with each node having a 1/N value as sum of each row would equal to 1.

THREAD: Parameter in Rocchio's method REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Alpha, Beta and Gammae --> they control the MOVEMENT of final Query vector along the Original Quwry, RELEVANT and NON-RELVANT centroids,respectively.. Alpha --> just factors up the original vector  If Beta is smaller then the new Query will be LESS closer to the RELEVANT centroid. as that component is ADDED. and No, Gamma should not be Larger as it will SUBTRACT more from the original query vector..  centroid -> cluster of docs (relevant or non - relevant) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think that beta should be smaller because it represents how much your new query vector should care about the relevant docs. Since pseudo feedback is less reliable, you don't really trust the centroid of the "relevant" docs as much, so you don't want to move your vector towards the centroid that strongly.   Similarly, gamma represents how much you want to move your vector toward/away from the non-relevant docs. I would imagine that since non-relevant examples aren't important in practice, it doesn't matter much what happens to gamma. However, you might not trust the "non-relevant" docs are actually non-relevant when working with pseudo feedback, so gamma might be smaller as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Dose smaller Beta means the new query will  be far away from relevant centroid, instead of closer? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, i mis spoke earlier, updated. But there are 2 things .. One is the definition of Apha, beta and gamma and what they control.. and then what is the affect of their values to the original query vector.  Since Beta is ADDED to query vector, the more the Beta... the more we add to the original query and hence... the nearer we go to Relevant docs.. if its smaller then the query vector will be LESS closer to Relevant docs... The Gamma on the other hand is SUBTRACTED... so the larger the Gamma, the more we subtract from original vector.. i.e. the more Far we go from original vector i.e. closer to non relevant vector...   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So, the gamma should also be smaller, right? Since we also do not want the irrelevent vector influence our original vector. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That's Correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That is the exact reason that modern systems remove the gamma component. They are basically weights apha beta gamma... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The lecture says that you should not give more importance to the algorithm (adjustment of scores) to what the user intended to look for (what he typed query wise). A large value of beta would override what the user types in as keywords. For gamma, it should be less (or 0) since negative feedback pulls you in all directions, thus creating not totally useful distraction (as per the lecture). 
THREAD: Practice quiz problem REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: IDF --> Inverse document frequency.  i.e. it would be 1 / df  i.e. log (N+1)/df(w)  in this formula it is using df(w) directly... which is incorrect. as it will change the overall unit of the score..  Rest.. is correct like doc lenth normalization --> it is a unit less quantity.. So thats why even if it is inversd, it will still result something..

THREAD: quiz 3 average precision REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Average precision denominator is always the relevant document count which is 4 here. Numerator is sum of precisions at the + positions so AP(A) = (1/2)/4 = 1/8 AP(B) = (1+1)/4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So  look at this,  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cfb2e033-c314-404b-9646-99c032eb631e/image.png)  So based on the above rule, A has 1 "relevant retrieved" and 9 "irrelevant" retrieved i.e c = 9.

THREAD: question 4 from quiz 4 confusion REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you look at the formula for Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and apply the same with lambda being 0.5, you get this answer. Remember that probability of all words in the query = p(w1) * p(w2). using the P(w|C), for the second document, it will come to (1/3) * [(1/2)*(1/3)] instead of it being 0 without smoothing. Please look at the formula mentioned in the Week4 Lecture 6, 4th slide. Hope this helps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I see the formula that you mentioned, but i can't seem to understand how it ends up coming to (1/3) * [(1/2)*(1/3)].  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: P("online" | D2) = (1 - 0.5) * (1 / 3) + (0.5) * (1/3)  This is by applying the formula, which comes to 1/3. P("course" | D2) = (1 - 0.5) * 0 + (0.5) * (1/3) It is 0 because there are 0 matches for course in D2. 0.5 is the lambda and 1/3 is the P("course" | C). This comes to (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6. multiplying both probabilities, we get: (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/18). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So, as per JM smoothing, words may have a p(w|C) i.e. there probaility in the Collection. and based on that a smoothened overall probability can be derived for each word. (formula in the image)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cc496c64-6866-40ba-9ef4-301183cbf58d/image.png)  Now P(Q|D1) = p("online"|D1) * p("course" | D1)  now, for D1 --> online and course has the probability 1/3 each --> 1/9 (refer the image)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/58631d4e-8806-4318-b73f-a6ebbbc4753f/image.png)  for D2 --> since we have only "online" from the Query and no "course", So the calculation will be 1/3 8 1/2*1/9 (refer image)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4717e98d-cd6a-44de-9f0b-80117c071373/image.png)  the "education" is given only to confuse :D It has nothing to do with calculation.  isn't that Ironic LOL 
THREAD: Quiz 4 Question 3  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: So, whenever it says WITHOUT SMOOTHING, what it means is that if there is any word in query which is not there in document,   then it PROBABILITY becomes ZERO. (One of the drawbacks of Unigram Model, that's why smoothing is required)  now Overall p(w1 w2 w2.. wn) = p(w1) x p(w2) x p(w3).. x p(wn)  i.e. multiplication.  So, P(Q|D1) = p("online"|D1) * p("course"|D1) = 1/3 x 1/3 = 1/9  (why ? probability of picking "online" from one of the 3 words in D1 and so on)  hence for D2 here .. p("course"|D2) = 0  i.e. the overall P(Q|D2) = 0 
THREAD: week 5 practice quiz q1 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If a user is on a webpage. User has two options either to navigate to any hyperlink on that web page or to navigate randomly to any other page.   Page Rank comprises of two parts One: Transition matrix to navigate from Web Page 1 to any other web page through hyperlinks Two: Randomly jumping to any page (not following the hyperlink) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If random jumping didn't exist, then we would only be able to navigate through links, so 1. we couldn't reach disconnected pages.  2. once we get to a page with zero outlinks, we're stuck there (there's nowhere else to go).  This process naturally favors nodes with more incoming links because there are more ways for us to reach those nodes. Therefore, the correct answer is the first choice. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: PageRank favors nodes with more number of incoming links 
THREAD: The degree of freedom of the transition matrix REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is as per linear algebra to find parameters and degree of freedom of a matrix REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Unless a page doesn't have links to other pages (i.e., a sink), it has to go to another page sooner or later and this probability sums to one taken across all other pages. However, when there is no other link(s), then the probability of staying on that page forever is one (?)

THREAD: Can anyone explain the gamma decoding for the below question? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Gamma encoding is divided into 2 parts - Unary and Binary  Count till 1st occurrence of ZERO starting from left hand side...  so that gives you the Unary part i.e. 1110 --> that is 4 in unary ( N-1 bits of 1s and one 0 ), make it equal to k + 1 = 4 and that gives you k = 3 (which determines your next k bits for Binarry part)  so next k bits are - 010 --> that makes 2 in Binary (0x2^2 + 1x2^1 + 0x2^0)  then the actual interger value will be 2^k + r where r is your binary part. Hence 2^3 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks a lot. Just for clarification, The last step in 2^3+2 right? r is 2 right?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For this question, you can find 3 1s before the first 0, which leads to 2 ^ 3 After the first 0, you find 3 bits 010, which leads to 2.  so the total is: 2 ^ 3 + 2 = 10  Also, list some examples for you to know more  9 = 8 + 1 = 2 ^ 3 + 1 so 3 1s + 0 + 001 so 111 0 **001**  10 = 8 + 2 = 2 ^ 3 + 2 so 3 1s + 0 + 010 so 111 0 **010**  Generally, 2 ^ x + y x 1s + 0 + binary of y using x bits REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yup..

In this case 4 pseudo segments each carrying weight of 0.25.  w1=0, w2=0  w1=1,w2=0 w1=0,w2=1 w1=1,w2=1  There are 2 pseudo segments for w1=1. Hence 0.5 got added ( 0.25 + 0.25 ). There is only 1 pseudo segment with (w1=1,w2=1). Hence 0.25 added.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Do you have a different system, which can be used for the exam? Both the ProctorU extension, and the executable file (LogMeIn) are likely to hit corporate security restrictions, and prevent you from taking the exam.  I'm not sure if the extension itself is necessary, but the latter can definitely cause issues even if you can take the test without the extension.

I am logged into their website but I don't see it anywhere?

Following the right side of the following pic, we use x1, x2 ,,, to count the relevant docs for System A. And use y1, y2, ... for System B.  From the question description, x1 >= y1, and x2 >= y2, ....  For sure System A bigger recall for position 1, 2, 3,....  Pay attention that: only the diver is different compared to P and R, but same for System A and System B.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/bb4083c6-34cf-427c-a719-24f939121681/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: lets say the precision of A was x out of k documents. For B it was y for the same K (the Q says for any number of K). let D be the set of all relevant documents. It follows then  x > y (for any number of K)  it implies: x/D (recall) > y/D  Hope that makes sense. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Precision = number of retrieved documents that are relevant/number of retrieved documents.  Recall  = number of retrieved documents that are relevant/number of relevant documents.  The denominator in the two expressions above for the two systems A and B are the same since the number of retrieved documents (i.e., k) is the same for A and B and the number of relevant documents is fixed. So, the differences are in the numerators. if numerator(A) > numerator(B) for precision, this relationship holds for recall as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So, the only different parameters are "b" and "c".  Precision inversely proportion to "Irrelevant doc retrieved" i.e. "c" Recall inversely proportion to "Relevant Not retrieved / rejected" "b"  If A --> has Higher precision than B --> that means number of Irrelavant docs retrieved are LESS i.e. Relevant doc retrieved is MORE... that means Relevant doc rejected is LESS --> "b" is Less... That gives --> HIGHER RECALL....as Recall inversely proportional to "b" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: System A always retrieves more relevant documents than System B for any given number of docs retrieved.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's a one liner: Visualise the curve! At all values of recall, if precision is higher for A => this implies that A sits above B. Extend this analysis to the other way round: draw a horizontal line at a given precision, the curve above will always have a higher recall (x) value for A! 
THREAD: Parameter in F test REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 6]: From the question, it is supposed to have a bigger R to ensure potential attacks can be found. See the first pic below, if beta increase, R becomes a bigger and bigger factor.  Let us get a limit when beta -> infinity, you can know F is R. In the reverse way, F is P.  To summarize, F is between P and R.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here's my take. We want a high recall having an impact on F measure,  If we set B to a very, very low number, like 0.00000001. At this point, the B^2 * P would be so small, it would be almost negligible, wouldn't it? Also, the numerator (B^2 + 1) would be basically 1. Our formula now becomes F = P * R / R = P, so you can see setting B lower results in Precision having a massive impact on F measure.  On the contrary, we set B to very high, like 100000000. At this point, the (B^2 * P) is so huge it overshadows the R in the denominator, so we can ignore the R. Our formula becomes F = (B^2 ) P * R / (B^2 * P) = R.  From the simplification, high recall will give us a higher F measure, if we set B to very high. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A higher parameter value gives more weight to the recall: this is because if we increase Beta, intuitively the coefficient of P in denominator will increase leading to overall decrease in effect of P over the final value.

THREAD: IdealDCG REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]:  In my view,I think it because if all rated "3", we don't need a multi-level relevance judgments. It just have one level? Not sure if this is right.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: That's just the example given. The main idea is that the ideal DCG will have the highly rated values (values rated 3) at the top of the list, and lower values at the bottom. E.g., a doc of rating 2 will be ranked under all the  docs rated 3, and a doc rated 1 will be under docs rated 2.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The assumption is that there are only 9 documents that are rated "3" in the collection, so the Ideal DCG @ 10 for that collection can't have 10 "3"s, so assigning a "2" to the 10th document in the ideal case is the most optimal scenario given the assumption. Of course if there are more than 10 "very relevant" documents, then it would make sense for all 10 to be rated "3". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Since we only have 9 documents rated "3" in this example. So for the 10th document, the best we can do is rated it as 9. You can check the video: Lesson 3.5 at 6:34. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is assuming that the user who deemed this "ideal" ranking thinks of the first 9 documents as having utility 3, and the last one having utility 2. Remember: *the ideal ranking need not have all values as maximum! Its an ideal "ranking"!*, something possibly crafted by a user in this context.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Its always with respect to the word. So Doc frequency is - How many documents contain that particular word. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: See this pic.  The minimum case: term 1 and term 2 are using the docs / Accumulators.  The max case: term1 and term2 are using different Accumulators.    ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cc63d4a9-1fc0-4c69-a10f-86f92e3e1da5/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See the pic below:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We know that we need atleast 1000 accumulators to uniquely store document counts of the word having 1000 frequency (maximum of the two).  "minimum" implies that this is best case i.e. the other word always appears in some of these 1000 documents, and we dont need more accumulators.  The "maximum" i.e. worst case would be that all 100 instances of the other word appear in separate documents (mutually exclusive from the previous 1000 ones), leading to 1000+100 = 1100 accumulators.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In short, Minimum is the best possible case where least document you need.  w1 present in 1000 documents. and w2 present in 100 documents. For the best possible case, which ever term having highest number of doc count (in this case w1 document count 1000) will contains all the w2 also. so 100 documents from w2  is part of those 1000 docs too.  
THREAD: Simple VSM  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Lets say using word count, the term count of a word is "x" in a particular document. By concatenating the same document you are just multiplying the EXISTING count of EACH word by 2 (doubling up the count) i.e it becomes "2x" But this happens for all other words as well !!! isn't it ? So the overall ranking won't change...  For eg. Harry has 2 wands, Ron has 1 wand, Dumbeldore has 3...  even if you multiply all their wands by twice or thrice or N...... it is still dumbeldore who ranks highest...  This is how i understood this.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Given a term from Q, if it exists in D, the corresponding bit is 1 regardless of how many times it occurs. Otherwise, the bit is 0.  To summarize, we only care a term exist or not, but we do not care the count times.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the question is about word count, not bit vectors.. what you explained is how bit vector will work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes. Same ideas:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Why this question is duplicated somehow?

Sometime that helps REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Should those with large word count doc rank higher？ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Oh I understand what you say... I think our problem is what "concatenate each document by itself" really means. Does this means repeat this doc? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: without TF transofrmation or IDF , there won't be any change if we concatenate the SAME documents (any number of times), as the same MULTIPLICATION FACTOR is being applied to ALL the words (in the query) which are available in the document.  Think like this, harry has 2 wands, Ron has 1 wand, Dumbeldore has 3...  even if you multiply all there wands by twice or thrice or N...... it is still dumbeldore who ranks highest... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It would maintain the same ranking, only change every score by factor of 2.  If Z > Y > X  then 2Z > 2Y > 2X REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A one liner: Let * represent dot product initial score = dot product = a*b new score = dot product of doubled vectors = 2a * 2b  We increase by a constant positive scale of 2 => No change in ranking!

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you mean the number of bits in the binary part? yes.. since the number of bits to be used = floor(log x) and  in this case floor(log 9) = 3. So that many bits will be used to define the Binary part of the Gamma encoding.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: or if you are asking about the unary part... The 1110 = 3 (as per unary) which is (x-1) bits of 1 and followed by a 0 bit. i.e. 4 --> 111 (3 1s) and then 0 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The solution is also given there itself, once you mark the correct answer. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How does the floor of log(9) which you computed to be 0.95929 become 3?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: oh... LOL... That is just a rough note for log 9 base 10... I forgot to remove it.. Its not relevant here as the calculations are done based on base 2... LOL Removed it now..

THREAD: External APIs in Project REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Molly,  You are allowed to use APIs for results, but make sure your project builds on top of the APIs (such as additional analysis or reranking results based on your own ranking methods). In other words, think about how to leverage the APIs to go beyond the APIs themselves, if that makes sense. We want to avoid the case where an entire project consists of just API calls, since that isn't very novel.   Also, Google search API, to the best of my knowledge, is not functional anymore. However, Bing has a publicly-available one: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That makes sense, thank you!

That said, Yes you can have 1 person team (I myself confirmed it with TA Kevin), as far as you can justify 20 hours of project work.

THREAD: (Lecture-2) TF IDF query term frequency?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: If your query is "presidential presidential".  term frequency when written as c(w,q) means number of times the term appears in the query (w -> term, q -> query). So, for the term presidential, c(w, q) here would be 2. Any where you see c(w,q) in the formula it would be 2 for this specific scenario.  If your query is "presidential presidential", you still have no information on the document d. c(w, d) means the term frequency in the document (w -> term, d -> document). To find c(w, d) you need to know how many times the term "presidential" appears in the document.     Does this answer your question?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, this answered my question thank you.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: In addition to above explaination,  The TF (w,d) in the lectures (Week 2) shows only Sublinear transformation for c(w,d) i.e. count of words in the document or term document freq.  So, the formula replaces c(w,d) with (k + 1) c(w,d) / c(w,d) + k   Now, just above that transformed formula it mentions k1, k3 , but doesn't really explains where k3 is used, while k1 is actually the k in above TF (w,d)  So, in expanded version of OKAPI BM25, the c(w,q) is also TRANSFORMED where k3 is used to transfrm the c(w,q) ---> TF (w,q) this is how the final formula looks like.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a872e805-461e-464b-a4d2-6828fe06c55a/image.png)  hope this clarifies a bit more. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: thank you for the explanation! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As a way to approach this: Think of all additions like TF and IDF as an extra heuristic over the base formula: the dot product, which has two components: query * document  The heuristics we add in VSM apply to the document part of it, *the query part always is either bit vector or query count*

If Zipf's law doesn't hold, it implies that many words have higher probabilities, so the number of documents containing each words will be higher. This implies that the number of documents in each posting file will increase as well.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As I mentioned  you should be able send private post to the Instructors/TAs and also send an email to Prof Zhai asking for advice. They should be able to help you with your password etc.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am at different time zone. It is very strange that I can book the exam successfully. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I will do that. Thanks for the chat. I arranged a day off for the exam. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes the time zone difference might have created this confusion. And It shouldn't let you book the exam outside of the exam window.   Unfortunate that happened. The Instructor can help you with this if you explain your situation to them. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I got exactly same problem. It makes no sense, as Proctor u allowed to book a slot 12 hrs before the exam opens. However, even coursera did not make sense. Why did they allow to unlock password 12 hrs before the actual window of exam.  I had to reschedule it today. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The reason is the day to allow unlock 'ProctorU Password - Exam 1' is today. but the exam unlock time is tomorrow. I think there is a mistake on these settings. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is clear that the Proctor and Our TAs & Prof do not stand on the same page.  If you cannot get a quick feedback from TAs, but you want to finish it as earlier as possible, you may book another one to write it, and get a refund later.   
THREAD: Probability of two words  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it’s incorrect because it doesn’t apply to the unigram language model. The model looks at the probability of generating individual words, not multiple alternate words. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Pay attention to "Unigram model",  Yes. It is a little misleading. Given a general random variable, for sure you are correct. Now we are talking about a sequence contains "A" or "B"  P(a sequence contains "A", or contains "B") = P(a sequence contains "A") + P(a sequence contains "B") + (a sequence contains "A" and "B")  You may explain the questions as following:   For A: A sequence contains:  "A" and "B" For B, A sequence contains:  "A" "B" "C" or    "C" "A""B" For C, A sequence contains: "A" or "B"  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5133d168-982a-4753-a182-54faad229fe5/image.png)  Think about this one to get a vivid picture on Unigram LM ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/64a64725-2246-4aba-9fc3-1748aaf102db/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I understood it to represent the occurrence probability of two independent events (A,B). Therefore, we take the sum of the two individual probabilities. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think Kurt is correct. Unigram model doesn't cover the "A" or "B" scenario. 
THREAD: Exam 1 coverage REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "The exam will cover materials from W1 – W6", so W7-materials are not part of the examined material.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the clarification, and I wonder if W1-W6 materials will be covered on the final exam? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. Exam 1: Week1 - Week6  Exam 2: Week7  Onwards  (Week1 - Week6 is not part of Exam 2)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Here: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs410/fa2021/ it states, "The first exam, which covers the first 6 modules on Text Retrieval, will be given in the middle of the semester."

So if you have encountered any unexpected challenge or interruption in your study that affects your capacity of finishing a quiz or MP on time, please do request an extension by posting a "private note" on campuswire with an explanation of your situation." 
THREAD: Implicit feedback in TR REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Even I feel just document click should not be sole criteria for marking the document relevant. But I feel that is one of the most common way - better than having none. Another implicit feedback could be  time spent on the page. Maybe a combination of click and time spent on a page would be a better implicit feedback.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: From the lecture, through the user's click-through, we just get some ideas, and we assume they are relevant to the query. And also, it says this kind feedback is not reliable.  Pay attention to the following difference. You can find no feedback solution is perfect. we nee to have some assumptions.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/cd12c5e7-e94c-4f9c-aa0a-5f66c1af5b69/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3bfd9615-5499-42f1-b4af-8a642d04d4a1/image.png)   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3843a25d-97ba-4bfc-9638-e2094c483e21/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also I would like to add few of Prof Zhai's word from the week-5 (Video 5.1).. He also mentioned about initially displaying a snippet not just a link   ```clue about whether the document is useful to the user. And we can even assume that we're going to use only the snippet here in this document, the text that's actually seen by the user instead of the actual document of this entry..... If the user tries to fetch this document because of the displayed text we can assume these displayed text is probably relevant is interesting to you so we can learn from such information```  Even if you see the google search.. it does display a snippet which makes the user to make an initial judgement based on the snippet to click on the document or not: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/3a326c66-6b5e-4eea-becf-16d3bfa9f5a8/image.png)  Now this judgement can be initially made by observing clickthrough of few users, but over the period the relevance becomes more accurate by observing the clickthrough data of thousands of user on the documents.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Perhaps the best case is relevance feedback since the judgments are reliable in this case, followed by implicit feedback that includes some feedback from the user even though judgments are not completely reliable, and then pseudo/blind/automatic feedback where the judgments are not reliable. 
THREAD: Quizzes 1-6  
THREAD: precision vs recall curve - why only chart the first precision value for a recall REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: About the lower precisions being 0:  0 isn't the actual precision, but the actual value is unknown because we don't know how many more documents we'd need to retrieve to get any remaining relevant documents. So I think 0 functions as a lower bound. The instructor basically says this is a convenient shortcut to let us create a measure to compare retrieval methods. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Kurt already answered the question about the precision being 0. It's indeed an arbitrary decision to simply assume all those precision points to be zero, but this assumption is unlikely going to favor any particular method, so it's still okay to use this measure to compare different methods.   Regarding your question about the computation of the precision-recall curve, it's another assumption made for convenience. Please see this document for a detailed description: https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec15/appendices/CE.MEASURES06.pdf . Your idea of doing a weighted average also makes sense.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you professor!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: From the lecture, we only care the new relevant doc. Others do not bring so much value.

THREAD: EOWC and document length normalization REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: > The lecture examples compared pseudo-documents of equal length.  Did not find it in slides. Are you talking about slide 7-8? Which page?   EOWC is used to measure the similarity between two docs. It is not mandatory for two docs to have the same document length.

Note that "N" on the slide is the total number of *unique* words in the vocabulary, not the length of a document.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you, I should have read back over the slides. I was thinking of the direct comparisons of "Right1" and "Window8", which used segments of equal length. The final form uses vectors based on the vocabulary size.

THREAD: How stemming improves recall and decrease precision ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Please see a very good explanation at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming).  Stemming may result in two words being classified with the same stem that may not be related. One e.g. for Porter stemmer stems "universal", "university", and "universe" to "univers". This is a case of overstemming. This will result in losing precision at the cost of recall. If our search is for university even the documents with universe will be returned, reducing precision.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Great, thank you !! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: recall = TP/(TP+FN)  and FN+TP=P (the number of positive examples). So, recall=1 - (FN/P). Since P is fixed for a data set, increase in FN => decrease in recall.  precision = TP/(TP+FP).  Overstemming increases FP. Since FP is not directly related to TP (i.e., FP comes from negative examples that are incorrectly identified as positives, whereas TP is from the positive examples that are correctly identified as such), TP can remain the same. So, precision decreases with increase in overstemming.  Understemming increases FN and therefore decrease in recall.

THREAD: Grading for MP3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: #870 discussed a variant of this question with no resolution REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just do it step by step. If you really know what is expected, It is not really very complex.  You have 2 more weeks.   Send a private msg to TA if possible, as many guys may answer the question to resolve it automatically. I will keep it to be unresolved. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In some of the previous MPs we did there were rubrics for credits based on completion of each steps.  In MP3 https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP3 there is no such Rubrics for completing any steps which might mean there might not be any partial credits.   However, you can send a private post to the Instructors/TAs asking the same question and you might get a faster response. The deadline for this MP3 is not week7 deadline.

THREAD: Recommendation for how many people in one team for project  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: As per the document each team member should have approx 20 hours of "quality" work  in the project. So the team formation is also heavily dependent on project topic and scope. For e.g. 1 member team should have ~20 hours quality work on the project  2 member team should have ~40 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 3 member team should have ~60 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 4 member team should have ~80 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) 5 member team should have ~100 hours quality work on the project (each member ~20 hrs quality work) ... ... So with increase in team members project quality work also increases. Something to be considered while forming teams.   Large size team also possible for larger project provided approval from the Instructors.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A few more related to this question.... 1. Does the course project need to result in a working "system" or involve data analysis? 2. I ask (1) above because some courses allow "literature review" as the report. CS410 is not "some other course" of course.. 2. How is "20 hours of quality hours" measured? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes, the goal of the project is for you and your group to apply the topics that you learned in this course to create or analyze something.  2. Good literature reviews are very hard to do, especially with only 20*N expected hours of work and in popular fields such as ML, NLP, or IR. I would recommend sticking with building something, but if you're very interested in a literature review, please let me know.  3. It isn't measured per se, but rather provided to guide the amount of work that you should (and we) expect.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It depends on your project proposal - projects that aim to tackle a larger task will benefit from more members.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your answers. They all make sense now.

THREAD: Exam format  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think its the same format as quizzes .. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See #713   Yunan Zhang answered this question 17 days ago  It depends on how you define longer formulas. Exam1 should be as easy as freshman-level statistic courses and discrete math courses. If you understand how the formula works, you would know how changes in input would affect the output, and how to plug in numbers for simple cases. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My previous question at #713, "Does " If you understand how the formula works, ..." mean that we have access to the formulas (not memorized but on a sheet of paper, for example)?" was not answered. So, I am guessing that we need to memorize all the formulas REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Exam Questions will be of similar format like the weekly Practice and Graded quizzes (which is multiple choice).    Regarding the formula, as instructor mentioned in #713, they want us to understand the pieces how the components are related in a formula and understand how changing one component might affect the behavior.    #940 has more details about no of questions, hour and how to schedule etc.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes it's similar to quiz.

THREAD: LiveData lab issue REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am assuming you created the webhooks, like previous exercises. Do you see any submission at all for 2.4?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I did create web hook. but still I don't see any submissions. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My token was about to expire for github, please check its not the same case for you. If the token expires, webhooks wont work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It was expired but I created a new token and did the setup once again. I see in the Webhook delivery response that GitHub account was not found. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After you generate your new token, did you delete the linked account on liverdatalab and created a new linked account?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I did that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Even though it might be an repetition. but you can delink all the linked accounts in levedatalab using the `Delete Linked Account` .. and try generating a new token and create a new linked account with the new api token.   Also, you can also make sure you followed all steps thoroughly step 3 onwards from the doc `LiveDataLab setup.pdf` that you can find in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I tried that as well twice but still no luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you see the submission line and see logs in livedatalab?   Also, do you see any warning sign on your webhook? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I do not see any logs in Livedatalab. In Webhooks I see HTTP 401 error saying Github account not found  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So it is an issue with your webhook. Check if you have copied the correct webhook url (with no period at the end). The webhook url you can get from the pdf i mentioned above.   It is still part of the process Step 3 onwards. Make sure you see no errors in each steps else you will have issues (like the webhook).  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I tried everything, URL is correct.

Then it should get resolved.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes I did REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you did all the steps exactly as in the pdf you shouldn't have any issue... :) Trying to understand which one you did differently (or perhaps missed)...  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 401 usually means unauthorized ``` The HTTP 401 Unauthorized client error status response code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. This status is sent with a WWW-Authenticate header that contains information on how to authorize correctly.  ``` So I still believe it has do do something with your token or access related. Also something I am failing to catch on your steps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also keep this post unresolved if someone else wants to join and extend help.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also if you still need help,  keep this post unresolved so if someone else wants to join and extend help.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Alternatively, reachout to the TAs as well in a private post and they can things better from their side.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Finally figured it out...the issue was while linking the account in LiveDatalab my Mac was automatically changing the url as GitHub.com (upper case) instead of guthub.com (all lower case).

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's hitting this section of code I think based on your output.  So, I'm not sure how you updated that part of code to run in your notebook.  I honestly don't think you need to try to run this in a notebook and just run from the CLI. It's fast enough. It's also better I think if you submit to LiveData for feedback against the test dataset.   ``` if len(sys.argv) != 2:     print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))     sys.exit(1) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you didnt use the command line before and were just doing it in a note book you could do something like this     ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/459caa2a-d99a-450e-8131-e810b5d53bda/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is hitting the `sys.exit(1)` code section. It should get the config.toml from the current directory which in your case is not happening.  Launch the notebook from the directory where you have `config.toml` and `search_eval.py` files and then you should be good.   However this error should not impact your submission to leaderboard as the autograder will call only your `load_ranker(...)` function. But you need to fix this bug to if you want test your parameters locally for cranfield.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can try to find APNews dataset online and if you get it you can download it to your machine and test it.  If you are able to fine tune your parameters for AP News and Cranfield you should be able to score higher.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Maybe the faculty data set was the one collected earlier in this course REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The APNews and Faculty are hidden datasets used by the autograder for evaluation of the parameters. However, one can submit unlimited number of times to improve the score based on the outcome of their parameters   I dont think there is exact copy of those datasets available online. Not that I am aware of.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We'd need test queries and relevance judgements for the AP dataset too, though.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: now, I am using load_ranker, but surprisingly, the output on my own machine is not reflected on the leaderboard.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Optional videos are for more information (they aren't part of the syllabus). In the midterm exam, there won't be any questions from optional videos. Prof Zhai confirmed too.   For other courses too, optional videos were never part of any exam. So no worries there.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The content from optional sections help us understand the concepts in the required sections better from a high-level perspective. And, it's minimal additional effort to go through those... 
THREAD: M2.4 trying to reach baseline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #965 will help you reach the baseline by just adjusting BM25 parameters. If you want to top the leaderboard you may have to do multiple fine tuning efforts in livedatalab.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Basically check the optimal ranges for the params, then fine tune them.

THREAD: Is livedataLab down for 2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is working well for me. If it is failing, you may post the error msg here, so we may know the reason like: your github token expired REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: could be that your GitHub access token expired. See #945 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Any chance your github token expired? If yes, then startover with Step 3 from the LiveDataLab setup.pdf from https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview  Also this post might help you: #904 #945 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It worked for me yesterday as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If its still failing for you, Can you paste the screenshot of the Exxecution log on the LiveData lab ? That might help debug that  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Turns out my github token was expired, thanks for the help! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, I encountered the same problem and didn't fix it after I renew my token. Can I ask the exact steps on how you fix the problem? 1. Generate a new token. 2. Link new account to LiveDataLab. 3. Push commit again. Did I miss something?

But then, how is alpha (and, in turn, beta) determined?  
THREAD: Pearson Correlation Coefficient vs Cosine Measure REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: These are just two similarity measures one can use to measure the similarity between two users. Here's a naive example: When you hop on to your favorite online shopping website, the system will check how likely you are going to like say, a lego set, based on the choices of top 3 (or any k) similar users to you. How do we quantify this similarity? By using either the cosine measure or pearson correlation coefficient.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I think these are the commonly used measures because they are easy to calculate (?) Perhaps any measure that computes the similarity of two vectors would be good.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Cosine looks at similar user and the ratings they have given to the item - it is easier to calculate and you dont normalize the ratings given by users (for example, a user which rates everything 5 is the same as one which rates only few movies 5), as long as ratings on similar items are same. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok I see. Is that in comparison to the Pearson correlation coefficient? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: no, compared to other methods where content rating is normalized (in a way comparing the magnitude of the vector too, not only the cosine distance).

THREAD: Can't beat baseline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: One approach is to try understanding and tweaking the BM25 parameters.  I believe that is being used as the baseline? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've been trying that, but the highest NDCG@10 that I've been able to get is .36 which doesn't beat the baseline  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Trying the BM25 parameters is one of the proven way of being success.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: Refer to this article on parameter tuning for bm25 [BM25 Parameter tuning](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch) You can try this with cranfield dataset as it is already provided. If you are able to get anything beyond 0.36 for cranfield, you should probably be good to go.   If you follow the suggestions, you will be able to meet the baseline. If you want to be top 10 or so you will have to try to fine tune your parameter for AP news. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you want to meet the baseline, read through the campuswire posts and you should be fine.  If you want to beat the leaderboard, I think you are on a wrong place here - it's a competition, we can't be all No.1 :). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The current No.1 should be able to answer this question, until someone else has a better approach and becomes No. 1  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I met the same situation as well.

I've been following the suggestions from it but cannot get anything higher than .36 for cranfield D: REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 0.36 should probably get you to above baseline REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The best way to arrive at optimal parameters is to loop through various values of b and k1 for BM25 between the values specified in [this article](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch). You should get values close to 0.36 and this should help you achieve baseline.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also can't get above 0.36 after parameter-tuning k1 and b. Not meeting the baseline :/ 
THREAD: Using compute resources REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 5]: 1. https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin previously offered free credit to UIUC students but that has to be enabled by the professor. In my CCA course we got upto $200 credit in aws educate account.There were certain compute resource restrictions though. You might want to send Prof Zhai email or a private post and see if he can help.  2. You can also try GCP by using the illinois.edu account But using the illinois.edu address, the account might be placed in the illinois.edu organization and organizational policies might get inherited to your account that will likely put lot of compute restrictions too.   3. Google Colab is free too if you want to run notebook based python codes. You can check colab.research.google.com. Google Drive is conected with Google Colab so storage will not be an issue either. You can pay for faster and long running jobs.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That’s a good answer, thanks. I’d like to hear from the TA team as well, so am marking the question as unanswered. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I searched, and there has not been any discussion about computing resources for student projects in this Fall'21 course. It'd be good to hear about this from the instructors. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if you are still looking for these resources then look for AWS. You can get a free account for 12 months and they offer almost all their services including compute resources within that timeframe.

We can imagine that: 1: Some guys write algo by themselves.  2: Some guys try various models with different parameters.  3: Some guys may try to take advantage of the dataset features.  To summarize, the ideas are unlimited. This is a competitive assignment, so not easy to share or discuss further:) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: How do we do this ("3: Some guys may try to take advantage of the dataset features.") if we don't know the features of the other two data sets? Or, is this information available somewhere? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is entirely up to you but since you do not have 3 dataset , this is more of a "try and luck" exercise for me since during my exercise with cranfield dataset given, my ranking function shows very good result with given dataset on my pycharm project but it overfits on other datasets , after that I really do not know how should I progress here unless I submit "trial and error"   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I tried with BM25...key is to play around the param value ranges REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you can do it 2 ways:  1. change the param values for BM25 2. use MP2.2 as a reference and create your own ranker function using MeTA.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It depends on you. You can finish this assignment either way.  I think the BM25 is one of the state-of-the-art models people use now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Trying the BM25 parameters is one of the proven way of being success. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 1. BM25 is state of art you can try fine tuning parameters. See [BM25 Parameter tuning](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch) 2.

You will have **two attempts** for each quiz, with your highest score used toward your final grade." REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think more than 2 but you can clarify with a TA.

But they did some changes in the quiz deadline penalties couple of week back and I guess while doing those changes, they might have forgot to add the two attempts restrictions which will work good in our favor.  As of now I see unlimited attempts week7 onwards but I would echo the same thing like rest are saying here,  limit your attempts to 2 only (following the course guidelines) as they might reenforce 2 attempts anytime.

Since it shows an error in plsa.py, which is the file you have to edit, and on a line you would be editing ("your code here" is at line 159), I'm guessing this is something in your code that's erroring, and you can't show it.  If it is building locally, check your python version as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe the auto grader runs python3.5 (you can print the python version on your program and then running a simple program on autograder). I hope if that is not the issue for you in case your local python version is higher.  Moreover you can try with the exact package versions (from your error snapshot) along with python3.5 to see if you are able to replicate the same error on your local machine? 
THREAD: General ProctorU exam tips? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Some people set up a new user account for ProctorU for privacy control. I typically change all the revised settings back after the exam. It takes just a few seconds. They mainly disable your screenshot shortcuts.   ProctorU needs to install a browser extension. I usually remove it after the exam.  I typically reboot my computer before the exam and leave only the needed programs (browser) on.   Be sure to have a mirror if you are using the camera in the laptop since the proctors will need to check your keyboard.   Leave your phone in the room. I typically put my phone in another room, but once the proctor asked me to show him the phone and leave it somewhere in the room I took the exam.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: What if I don't have a mirror?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: With ProctorU I can only say, Always Expect The Unexpected. (Feel free to disagree but this is what mostly my experience so far).  Every time I appeared for ProctorU exam, there were always glitches (mostly minor).  I listed all the points below that would "hopefully" address the Unexpected portions: 1. At times the wait times were higher for a proctor to join. Just be patient.  2. If you are using laptop camera (which I did all the time) some proctor asks for a mirror some don't. Btw, If mirror is not available, phone/tablet would work as well for reflective surface.  3. I wouldn't recommend using a work laptop as they take control of your computer (with permission) to disable stuffs  (based on what you have already installed including screenshot shortcuts) and that might conflict with your permission settings (specially mac). But if you can restore those settings then it would be fine (of course, they dont enable it back for you).    4. Once you schedule the exam, Check the exam rules from your sessions. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ecb915f3-77c2-48c4-afc4-53dd7e3d8235/image.png)  6.

THREAD: Ranking update on leaderboard for 2.4 
THREAD: MP2.4 learning? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think main learning is how to tune parameters of various models to achieve better search results. You could also improve existing models to improve the performance. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: > Is it just a hit or miss while **randomly** changing the parameter...  No! Parameter tuning is not about **randomly** selecting parameters. You should explore the parameter space in a more sophisticated manner, e.g., formulate an optimization problem or perform a brute-force or Monte Carlo search. Also, you are free to implement any ranking function on your own or use the (combination of) built-in ones in metapy. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There has to be some logic to this parameter "tweaking" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It is to help you understand the parameter ranges for BM25. For example the k parameter for BM25 has a range from 1 to infinity... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree with the sentiment here. Is this how the tweaking is done in the real world, or are there libraries that are built to optimize this? I considered writing a test driver script that would run through intervals of k1, b, and k3 and check the results, but I didn't have time. Maybe later. There has to be systems that do this!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think a script to obtain optimal results in my data sets will be better.

THREAD: Error in live data lab 2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: based on the log that you have shared, it appears that the program is still running in the lab. it takes a few minutes to start up the execution in the log before it fails.  can you share what failure message you are getting?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is what I see after I submit:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/88c5bc03-d34c-4187-bce1-38b29d728502/image.png)  The submission log does not change from the picture above REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Any chance your github token expired?  If yes, then startover with Step 3 from the `LiveDataLab setup.pdf` from https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview  Also this post might help you: #904 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: FWIW I have the same exact issue as well, it doesn't resolve itself after a few minutes either. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am getting the same issue, I resubmitted using code that got me a full score and it still fails. This issue from the Live Data Lab side and I do not think us students need to do anything about it. I hope an instructor updates us soon REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had similar issue in previous MP and got failure 5 times. It was caused by MP Github Link changed by TA and mine was still the previous guthub link. I solved it by reseting the github link to ```Livedatalab```. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue. Then I was told that my Github token had expired. After I renewed it, the submission started again. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Github token renewal helped for me as well REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Did you set up the webhook correctly REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: were you able to fix this issue? I am getting it as well. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try updating your github token, which may have been expired.  seemed to have solved the issues for others.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Do you have any updates on this? I renewed my github token and made sure webhook was set up properly. Still get the same message  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I had the same issue and got it resolved by generating a new token. Thanks for the note. 
THREAD: Confused about MP2.4 scoring and credit REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have that as an example, you can send a private post to Instructors and TAs and request them to look at your score.  The leaderboard ranking "view" changed today and it is currently not following any ranking logic other than the success and failures (last column) is randomly sorted.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The last column decides your real results after combining the results of dataset 1/2/3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/84aed718-f844-4289-9550-4b3d677f2223/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think current ranking is only based on the first score (APNews) not fourth score (Overall Score). I checked the numbers and believe the four columns are as follow:  -  NDCG@10 on APNews  - NDCG@10 on Cranfield  - NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset - "Overall Score" : 0.1* NDCG@10 on APNews + 0.3* NDCG@10 on Cranfield + 0.6* NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset  I don't think you will know whether you will receive extra credits after everyone finished submitting or stop trying new methods. Unless you have a very high overall score that secures you rank on the top.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Seems resolved. One of the TA responded in this post #951.  
THREAD: MP2.4 Set up  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try using locate command in unix to find the folder. maybe you created the folder in some other directory.  you can refer locate command here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/locate-command-in-linux-with-examples/ REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you couldn't locate your repo yet on your computer, maybe cloning again would be faster to keep you moving with the assignment. You can clone a repo as many times as you want.

THREAD: Changes to rankin MP2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes seems all jumbled up and not following any ranking logic except they are just randomly sorted based on success and failure (the last column 0/1). Maybe they are in middle of fixing the ranking logic. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  I also sent a private post to the Instructors/TAs and didn't hear back yet. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: On my screen it appears that they are sorted by the first column (I think thats the AP news one). I think it should have been by the total. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: cool.. lets wait for them to reply back REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I assume they will follow the last column, which integrate the results of dataset 1/2/3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/02a40c13-aeb8-47de-8f91-15996b3c07fc/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I still see some issue with the ranking  Can you please look at ranks 7-9 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/2cab98ad-24d0-409a-8298-b33ffd781198/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Seems resolved.

THREAD: Live Data lab token expired REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If your submissions are going through again without issues, yes you should be absolutely fine.   I know few classmates went through the token expiry issue and didn't have any issue with grading MP when they submitted with new api token.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to update my token and sync my Github with LiveDataLab (I can see my submissions), but my grade is not being updated in Coursera, even when I get a '1' for MP2.4. What could be the issue? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/66ee7927-aac2-4864-9983-fc077f7ddbef/image.png) im seeing that I hv an issue with the webhook. I havent tried to subbmit anything but I guess Ill see later REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If your grade doesn't show up on Coursera, please contact the professors. I did that last week and now it works (my MP scores are visible on Coursera) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: After you updated your api token, did you go to the LiveDataLab using the MP2.4 "Open Tool"  button. Previously classmates encountered grading update issues when they went to LiveDataLab directly and not using "Open Tool" button. Close your browser tabs with LiveDataLab (logout) and open using "Open Tool" button and see if you get your grade synced.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When I try going through the "Open Tool" my LiveDataLab login credentials don't work anymore. How can I fix this? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Any chance you forgot your credentials? Your credentials are generally one time setup and it should work. And I hope you have your illinois email as your account in LiveDataLab.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, I wrote down my password and username, but login still doesn't work :(  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Git token expiry and Not able to Signup LiveDataLab I think are not related (only linked account inside livedatalab is affected with git token change not the LiveDataLab login).   What happens when you try to signup again with your illinois account?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nevermind! It got fixed, and everything syncs up, thank you for the quick responses! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes I did the same and it perfectly worked fine REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hey Rhaam, I am having similar issue as yours where my web hook doesn't work and throws HTTP 401 error. Do you know how your issue was resolved? 
THREAD: 6.1-6.3 Learning to Rank REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe the optional tag may be a holdover from when the course was either  - Joined from the two halves of "Text Retrieval and Search Engines" and "Text Mining and Analytics"; or - Contemplated as only for 3 credit students vs 4 credit students.  I agree, it is a good section to go through and relevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What David said.. And with other courses mostly what I have seen, they keep reevaluating the course content every semester and make minor adjustments to keep it most updated and current. While doing that they mark few videos as optional so students can still go over those videos for knowledge but there are no quiz questions and exam questions on those topics. Or even sometimes like additional reads ( like papers, textbooks etc) , some videos are provided as additional lectures which is always helpful.   The Instructors would be however able to answer this best any specific reason.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I'd assume that it's not really optional and has valuable content since it's there for a reason.  
THREAD: MP2.4 fine-tune parameter REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used trial and error(Starting with default) and heuristicaly deduce the parameters, It did work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am curious how we can have some learning out of this MP? right now, it is just hit or miss by randomly changing parameters. Anybody have any suggestions on how to think for this problem? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes but doesnt seem like a very organized method (not saying I know of a better approach :-) ) - or is it the only possible way given the nature of the algorithms? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it has to deal with the value ranges for the 3 parameters BM25 takes. For example for the k parameter value, it can go to positive infinity compared to the other parameters like b. So you cannot have the k value in same range as b. Ideally k is a way higher value range than b. Objective of this exercise is to familiarize us to those ranges I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "...please make sure you do not overfit" - just wondering if this comment is generalizable across data sets. If the chosen parameter set leads to overfitting with one data set, will the same set of parameters lead to overfitting with the other 2 datasets as well? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Actually endless possibilities for fine tuning the parameters for any Ranker you chose. If you go through the ranker implementation and make yourself aware of the boundary values and how they impact the score then it might help you to fine tune better.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The problem with overfitting is that while your numbers might go up for the cranfield set, they might perform very poorly with other sets. if they lead to overfitting for all 3 (thus maximizing all 3 results), I would think thats the good news :-) at least in the given context. 
THREAD: MP2.4 Do we only have to submit NDCG@10? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You only need to implement the model, which will be used for 3 datasets. You do not control the output. It is like 2.2. You need to implement the same thing,  but the better results are expected. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I am guessing that we 'fine-tune' the model for the data set we have access to, and hope that this fine-tuning carries over to the other two data sets as well. 
THREAD: mp2.3 grading REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think as long as you finish the marking and submit your result you will get full credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You have to mark all the listed doc either relevant or not relevant. It is based on your judgement which one you want to mark relevant and which one not.  Once you mark all the listed document and submit, it is then considered you completed the assignment and get full credit (100%).  That's it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This exercise is for providing relevance feedback on the search system and so that it can improve it further. This can only be done manually. So as long as you can able to categorize them, you should get full marks  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: It's completely your choice - you need to decide whether a document is relevant or not based on the keywords. I.e., there is no incorrect answer for this assignment. Once you mark each of the documents that you are given as relevant or not, you're done and will receive 100% points for this assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You just need to do it based on your judgement and the marks will be granted

THREAD: MP2.4 Lambda parameter for JelinekMercer REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Try using metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75). "lambda" is a function in python and hence the syntax error. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks, that worked. Why is it different when we use say the DirichletPrior ranker, that time i explicitly say mu=0.5? Confused when you say Lambda is a function, is it not a parameter for the JelinekMercer function ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "Lambda Function, also referred to as 'Anonymous function' is same as a regular python function but can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword." I guess there is no such thing as  "mu function" in Python. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: `lambda` just happen to be a python keyword like `return` , `def`, `for` etc...  These keywords are reserved in python which means Python doesn't allow these keywords to be used as variables within the program.  So when you are trying to do   ``` metapy.index.JelinekMercer(lambda=0.75) ``` You are trying to assign a value to python reserved keyword `lamda` and that's why it is complaining. Likewise, you wont be able to do operations such as `return=2` or `for=2`. These will give `SyntaxError`.   On the other hand `mu` is not a reserved word in Python so you were able to do the assignment. The original JelinekMercer function is a C++ library which was binded to python to to able to use those C++ functions in python. So while C++ allows `lambda` as a variable but python doesn't.   Only workaround is you can provide the value of lambda like `metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75) `  and you should be good.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lambda is a keyword to declare anonyous functions in python. Keywords cannot be used as parameters or variables. JelinekMercer is written on C++ and hence this limitation is not applicable for the original function.   We can simply pass the parameter as positional argument as given above.  Another option is to explicitly pass lambda specified by a dictionary.  metapy.index.JelinekMercer(\*\*{'lambda': 0.75}) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just pass the value, like mentioned below.  metapy.index.JelinekMercer(0.75) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lamda is a key word for a kind of function also called an anonymous function

THREAD: MP2.3 excel sheet protected  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I do not believe you have to add the relevant counts for your query to the excel sheet. Column C in the excel sheet is to track the number of times queries used (max ~10 students may use the same query). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't have the access to update the count are we suppose to do it or do we need to let the TA update it for us? (I got a message saying that the column is protected , btw someone already updated the count for me) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: The count is calculated for you. If you add your query in that sheet you should see the count being displayed by the excel automatically (count: how many times the query has been used by other students).  If you still dont see the count, after adding your query just click on any random cell and then look at the count and it should display.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ah ok thanks, I was confused just know why the count was updated automatically after I refreshed the sheet after a while REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No need to worry about this count. It's automatically updated after each access by someone REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There is no need to calculate yourself. You just need to input your query selection and the count will be auto updated.   The execl will not be updated after your submission, and you have to do that mannually

However rank in leader board is not matching  the instructions. There are lot of submissions with higher ranks even if the overall score is below the baseline.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There is another question. I guess it loosely talks about this point - #884  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The rank is based on the overall score, but it uses a percentage of each document:  10% = APNews 30% = Cranfield  60% = Faculty  Each NDCG@10.

However overall score is not used for leader board ranking, instead only AP news score is used for ranking. Higher AP news score has higher rank. For example, overall score of 0.53 is at rank 6 where as 0.70 is at rank 12. This does not make sense. As per instructions rank should have been based on overall score.

This doesn't appears as true ranking system as it should be based on overall score and success attempts only. The current view appears to be based only on APNews Score. I already sent a private post to the Instructors and TAs letting them know about this. I can update here once I get a response from them.

THREAD: Credit for MP 2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 100% means full credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Will I extra credit also as my rank is in top 50 but the baseline score is 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you have full credit.  im not sure if its the same for this class, but Coursera takes in the highest score from all the submissions.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Will I extra credit also as my rank is in top 50 but the baseline score is 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You will likely not be considered for the extra credit calculation though, so be mindful of that if you're trying to get in the top 50 with a score of "1". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If your coursera grade section shows 100% you already got the credit.   For extra credit which I think they will calculate and end of hard deadline, only the top 50 ranked candidate with 1 as score will be eligible for the extra credit.   So for extra credit success 1 along with top 50, both are required.  
THREAD: Cant login into MP2.3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Update:Its working now. 
THREAD: MP2.4 Task REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You have to modify load_ranker function and select any ranker with appropriate parameter so as to ensure that your ranker performs most efficiently. The ranker that performs as per baseline will get 100%. In a way it is similar to 2.2 but additionally you have to ensure that you meet the baseline at least to get 100%.  The ranker that performs best as per leaderboard gets 5 points extra credit. Top 50 students get extra credit as per the following formula: max(0, 5-(Rank-1)/10) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So do we need to use cfg_file at all? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Few more discussions in these two threads  #856 #483 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: when you are testing on local machine you will have access to cranfield dataset, config file can handle this. But, other data sets like AP news is not available to us. When you submit your code in the grader it should automatically take other datasets into consideration. This also makes the assignment challenging because our optimized ranker should perform well over unseen dataset too.  This is what I have understood from readme, though I have not yet completed the assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: All the scores shown in the livedatalab should be above a threshold value. That will give you 100%. Anything above that will increase your ranking and will get you extra credit. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I didn't change any code except under the load_ranker function and was able to get full credit. One thing that might be helpful is to try a bunch of different ranking functions/parameters and run your code locally, so you can at least see the NDCG on the cranfield dataset (this was more helpful imo than blindly submitting each change to the leaderboard). 
THREAD: Quiz Review  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For some reason they aren't allowing this. Also discussed in #841   One idea that came out in that post is to take a screenshot before submission for future reference. During office hours we can request Instructors/TAs to let the students able to see their quiz responses in Quiz feedback for Graded quizzes (just like practice quizzes).  Unlike the graded quiz, Practice quiz questions and answers are always  available for review.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It seems like screenshots are the way to go for now REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the future, you could take screen shots of the questions with the answers before submitting the quiz and refer them.

THREAD: KL Model Clarification REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You can have a look at appendix **C.3** of the book. A simple Query Model $$p(w|\hat{\theta}_Q)=\frac{c(w, q)}{|q|}$$. So a simple Query Model could be similar to $$c(w, q)$$. But when it becomes a probability distribution, we can do something interesting with it. There are more explanations in appendix C.x that you can have a look. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The two are comparable, except the c value measures the occurrence frequency of a given word whereas the p value measures its probability 
THREAD: Late Policy for Submitting Partially Completed Assignments REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Technically you should get 70 on the submission you already submitted prior the due date... and 50% on the remaining 30 as it is past due date but before the hard deadline... which would total to 85. (100% of 70 + 50% of 30)   But I would recommend dont submit it yet unless you get a confirmation from the Instructors and TAs on that. Because if the math is wrong on the auto grader it might give you 50 (50% off 100) considering late submission for the entire work and not on just the remaining work..    I think you should send Instructors and TAs a private post asap explaining your situation and see what they say.  Also not sure in this course if the MP auto grader let you keep the best score or only the latest score. It should keep the best score (and not latest score) but I am not confident on that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Ideally, credit should be given for the parts based on when they were first submitted. Let's hope that that's the case. 
THREAD: Confirming credit for MP2.3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For MP2.3 I got the grade instant.   You can check the Grades section if you have received grade or not (not sure if you have already checked that).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/854c0a3f-ebdd-4733-91a3-076fcae24999/image.png)  The actual submission page wont show any grade for MP2.3.   If the Grades. section shows you haven't received your grade, while waiting also make a private post to the Instructors and TAs and let them know about that.  They might be able to help you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: ^ agreed. also got an instant grade! would suggest checking with TAs and the professor 
THREAD: MP2.3 Relevance Rubric? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you see they are contextually irrelevant for the purpose, you can mark the document as not relevant.    However, you might lose the information for faculty specialized in text mining etc. Ultimately, the whole collection is about the faculty and their corresponding data. Also the documents are hybrid in nature which means they came from multiple sources (multiple student uploads) and content style might not be uniform. So I took those factors in account to make best judgement while marking a document irrelevant.    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It's your choice - you decide what is relevant for your search terms although there is a ground truth. Perhaps this exercise is similar to the use of Captcha to label items in pictures REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it depends on your personaly judegment. It can involve keyword and symmantic meaning or anything underlying the text

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yep, follow the instructions in the PDF and make sure you choose your query in the excel file. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: MP 2.3 objective is to mark 20 documents returned by the query as relevant or not relevant.  MP2.3 instructions provide step by step on the login and running your query.  do not forget to mention about query selected by you in the sign up sheet. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, and mention the count number for that specific query REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No git repo. Yes for pdf. Easiest MP probably. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: No need to create a git repo. The instructions are clear on what needs to be done. Select (and sign up for the use of) search terms, determine which and how many of the documents are relevant, and submit your response.

They can help you to get back your 100% credit.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Once you got a score = 1 in livelab, before deadline, it should be fine for you. Send a msg to TA.

THREAD: MP2.4  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The datasets are used via the config.toml file. So I dont think we need to do anything to manually choose them as such...Even the faculty and apnews datasets are actually loaded in system but not shown to you. So I think the relevance judgements for those are also set in hidden config that is not exposed to us. We just need to loop through these datasets via config and generate our results. Not sure if this answers your question... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Is the APNews data set available anywhere that we have access to? What kind of data is 'AP News'? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Two of the three data sets are not provided to us, so we pretty much have to "guess" how the algorithm we implement will handle them. It's a weird approach and I think I'd have a much better understanding of the assignment and the algorithm implementation if we were able to actually see the impact the changes we're making have on the data sets. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The ask is to select a appropriate ranker in meta library in `load_ranker()` and tweak the parameters to achieve best results. You can only see the Cranfield dataset but when you submit the autograder will validate the ranker also on APNews and Faculty dataset which is visible only to the autograder.  However, they also mentioned you can write your own ranker function.  There is no limit an submission attempts to test your score and improve the rankers or the parameters based on sbumission results that you can see in the MP2.4 leaderboard.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your response. So, we also need to use loop to find the best (or good) parameters, like in MP2.2?  Best, ZiZi REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No looping here might not work perfectly because they will call your `load_ranker()` for the hidden datasets (APNews and Faculty).  You can run the looping locally to find the best parameters for cranfield dataset in your local machine. But keep in mind the autograder will test the parameters for all three datasets and not just cranfield. So there is bit manual work involved but you have got unlimited attempts too. :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Got you. 100% of clear now. Thank you again.  ZiZi

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The query_start is just the position where the program starts to evaluate the score. The query num is the length of content it should evaluate. In MP2.2, I don't think we have to be worried about these two variables too much (just leave them). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The labels are descriptive - i.e., 'query_start' is where the query starts the process and it proceeds until 'query_num' is reached.

THREAD: MP2.2 Lost on how/what to write to bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt files REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There are 2 ways of doing that... Way 1 - For each BM25 (or you can select any other ranker) and the InL2 ranker, Print the AVG_P (ONLY the value)  for each query and then copy paste (all the 225 lines) in to the respective .txt files.  Way 2: use the pythonic way and write the AVG_P (per line) into file using file writer.  Once you have those 2 files <selectedRanker>.txt and Inl2.txt Then you can  create a separate script to calculate the p-value.  Let me know if you need further explaination...  I have also detailed out the entire assignment steps over here in this Post... take a look..  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I can tell you're frustrating. After you've gotten the value, create a new text file that only contains the average precision score for each of InL2 and Bm25 test result. Name them respectively.  Load them into np.array. Performance this [function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) and the answer is what you need at the end. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried doing Way 1 just now, copying the values from the terminal by doing Contrl+Shift+C, but when I paste it into the .txt file, it all goes onto line 1, and so I'd have to manually separate line by line. Is this correct?  Way 2 is where I have questions, because I don't understand how I'm supposed to do that at all. You can see my post for the questions I have regarding file writing.  I did see your CampusWire post previously, but I feel like I'm still very lost as to how to accomplish anything. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, but I still don't understand how I'm supposed to achieve any of this, which is why I asked the questions above in the original post. I know I'm supposed to create a new text file that only contains the average precision score for each of InL2 and Bm25 test result (it said that in the instructions), but I'm very unclear as to how I'm supposed to do that, which is why I asked all those questions. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nvm, I tried Control+C instead and it pasted into 225 lines instead of 1. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: First try to PUSH and submit just the Ranker function. and get that 70% mark. that will tell you that your ranker is correct. Then move to the PART 2 of the assignment (the p-value) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have already submitted/pushed the Ranker function for the 70%, so that's why I'm working on Part 2 (the significance testing), and my questions are about Part 2.

Let me know if you were able to get it going !! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to complete the assignment. Thanks for the help! :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the loop that was provided in the code, there is a line that prints the MAP to command line. Right below that line, you can also write the MAP to a txt file.  f = open ("file_name.txt", "w") -> w will overwrite the contents of the file - do this outside the loop  In the for loop: f.write(str(MAP_variable) + "\n")  f.close() -> outside the for loop  At a macro level, you can do this process twice to generate the LnL2 and BM25.  First time you modify the code to use BM25 and write the MAP score on each line of a txt file. Second time you modify the code to use your ranker implementation of lnL2 AND modify the file open code to use the new file name for lnL2. Then execute the script a second time. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just a minor note to make that more concise, we can use `with` to avoid having to manually close `f.close()` (similar to Java's "try with resource").  The code we were provided already has a `with` statement for the `query_file`, but we can add a second file to that line with a `,`.  Resulting in:  `with open(query_path) as query_file, open('file_name.txt', 'w') as f:`

THREAD: MP2.2 ImportError: No module named scipy.stats REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: how you generated the significance value using `scipy.stats` need not to be included in the main code. That `scipy` code is considered a test code. Keep the file `significance.txt` file and that should be it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You need not post the scipy bit to github. You can write the logic for the significance test outside of the main script. This way you're not adding extra dependencies. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: For generating the significance.txt, create a separate python script. Then you can either keep it or ignore in the git versioning. Even if you push it, the grader will still accept it. Keep the PART 1 and PART 2 code separate. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it's past the assignment's due date now, but I handled this by moving the all the code that uses scripy **including the import statement** to the very bottom of the .py file. That way the grader application is able to run everything that matters and, even though it technically errors once it reaches the import at the bottom, it doesn't matter because it's already done its job.  Alternatively, you could have wrapped the scripy stuff in a `try`.

Knowing how unit tests are written, I can't imagine how the internal InL2 function is being tested. It seems more likely that the data coming out of the function should be evaluated? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: check whether you are using correct sd.* variables in score_one for each of the variable in the formula.  Second part of MP just checks whether significance.txt has a valid value within a given range. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have used math.log2 it will always be incorrect. Try changing it to math.log(cyz,2)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess it mainly tests your inl2.avg_p.txt instead of the function. So a correct score_one() and optimized parameter generate correct inl2.avg_p.txt.  One thing comes up to my mind is, have you revised the return part of score_one function?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am slightly closer  1. Despite implementing all the code in the jupyter notebook, I forgot that they are evaluating the .py file  2. I'm now getting the error  ``` ('ERROR: ', AttributeError("'module' object has no attribute 'log2'",)) ```  Despite having switched from log2 to log()  The troubleshooting continues....    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for your help... I think the issue is somewhere in my search_eval.py at this point REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Are you sure? If it is still throwing the error means you still have log2 somewhere. Try to do a command/ctrl + F and push your code again.And yes, please do not push you jupyter notebook. You would need two files at max. One would be to use scipy since live data lab basically can't import stuff and doesn't have all python libraries installed REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you were right. there was another instance of log2() in my code. full credit achieved thank you!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried to do the submission in 2 parts...  Try submitting the Part 1 code first.  i.e. do not include the Significance.txt.  And then see if you pass the 70% mark there.. If not then you have issue in your Inl2 ranker (which is likely the issue)  Try to make sure that you are using correct sd.<property> .

THREAD: MP2.2 Grade on leaderboard but no grade on Coursera REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you forget to "open tool"? If so,  do it, and commit your code again to github.  It is required to do it at least one time. Otherwise, the livelab score cannot sync to coursera.

THREAD: Safely remove python 3.7... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-uninstall-python/ will help. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you have python3.7 created as virtual environment... you dont have to immediately uninstall it. It wont do any harm.  Just create another virtual environment with python3.5 and keep using the python3.5 for the MPs.  That is the beauty of virtual environments. That dont interfere with each other and you can have multiple virtual environments on your system for multiple project requirements.

You mentioned that 2.7 works as well? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: seems you are already inside an virtual environment.. how have to deactivate that first (come out of it). And the create another virtual environment... python3.5 need to be separate virtual environment  Depending on what virtual environment package you using (seems you are using `venv`) follow the documentation to deactivate current virtual environment and create a new one. You should be able to create any virtual environment 2.7 or 3.5 whatever...   I use anaconda (`conda`) to manage my virtual environment. I also use pycharm.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/106  maybe this helps.  conda create -n env python=3.5 conda activate env  these commands should create and activate the python virtual env REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I suggested using pyenv to manage your python versions. It's  very handy and allows you to have multiple pythons on your computer. I have like 4 different versions for different projects. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would consider pumping the breaks on uninstall python. Occasionally, the operating system or packaged application may use it.   Consider pyenv install/uninstall instead 
THREAD: Rankers other than BM25 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For sake of completeness of the assignment, i would recommend to do the comparison significance with BM25. It might look for the files `bm25.avg_p.txt` and `inl2.avg_p.txt` . Since you have unlimited attempts. You can try your original route and if the grader is not happy you can switch to BM25.   The rubrics doesn't explicitly says it has to be bm25 so you might have benefit of doubt. :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did it with the other one and I named my text files completely different. I still got a 100%  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nice. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it explicitly say to compare with BM25 (initially it says to experiment with different algos but for comparison BM25 was mentioned). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Nope not needed  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am curious on what basis do you say that. what I see in the git readme is:  "Use BM25 as a ranker and create a file called bm25.avg_p.txt. Then use your ranker InL2 and create a file called inl2.avg_p.txt. Each of these files is simply a list of the APs from the queries. We want to test whether the difference between your two optimized retrieval functions is statistically significant."  if the TAs/Prof said otherwise, I apologize - but I dont see where it says BM25 was optional for comparison. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: At the beginning where they asked us to use one of the other 6 ranker functions plus parameters except bm25 to sweep parameters and get the comparison done. they showed us an example with bm25 that's why. Another reason I say that is because I did not use bm25 and still got 100% REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: oh yeah thats true - I dont think it checks for BM25 (or for that matter anything else probably) - I think the only ask was to implement Ln2 and provide significance.txt

No MAP. And nothing else.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, 1 line per query with the average value only. Therefore, both files should have 225 lines. 
THREAD: MP2.2 InL2 Variables REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I haven't pulled off the implementation yet, either but the log2 function is in the python math library  I've understood c(t,Q) to be the equivalent of "number of times term appears in Query" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In score_one you do not have to care about SUM. This is done outside the function and you do not have to worry about that.  c can be 1,2,3,4..... etc.  In score_one just implement the formula by ensuring that you are using correct sd.* variable for each.   In load_ranker just call your InL2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Below posts should answer most of your questions.  #782 #788  Search more in campuswire and you will plenty of reference.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: also this part:  *c > 0 = is a parameter = I have no idea where to even start with defining this variable in search_eval.py.*  This is a parameter already set up for you in the part of the class that you don't need to touch. It is defaulted at c=1, and to reference it in your formula you just call  ``` self.param ```

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I did submit and got a 1 but I'm pretty sure it's just checking p <.05 because everyone will have different ones  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: any value less than 0.05 means that there is significant difference between InL2 and BM25. value > 0.05 means there is no significant difference. Remember BM25 is state of art and very efficient. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You got 1 already, so it is fine.

With this method, crawler cannot find hidden URLs, as it is explained by other answers. However, crawler is possible to find hidden URLs, by other means. E.g., one known URL has the format of ```http://..../a1```, the crawler may try a URL of ```http://..../a2```. Although the latter is a hidden URL, the crawler tried to open it and then found it has contents.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi, The singular "c" is a separate parameter (which may vary as c > 0). (HINT: you will need to vary this to get the maximum MAP - Mean Average Precision out of your final InL2 ranker function.)  the rest c() are the various COUNTS of Term for Query or Document or Corpus (or Collections).  They are also referred as Query term count, etc.. (HINT: check the score data link)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: N is also total number of doc in corpus C. So N equals to c(t,D)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How do you assign c in the score function? If I simply put c>0, the error will be "c is not defined". REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No, N would be sd.num_docs I believe. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The c is the self.param in the constructor. that's what you need to use. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: c is something to be mapped with self.param on your code. You would get your best results by changing the parameter which essentially means by tweaking the value of c.   C() (for e.g. c(t, Q), c(t, D) etc.) on the other hand are the calculated values that you will get from the score_data. You can't change the values of c().    
THREAD: InL2 not implemented correctly REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: with this value of MAP, p value seems to be incorrect. How did you calculate p value. Did you use scipy? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I use Rstudio to compute p-value which is 0.03487. I actually get the 0.3 points for part2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did it come as 0.03 or did you truncate it to 0.03? Generally it is a big floating number. Were you able to tweak your parameter to maximize your MAP ?  You have to explore with different values in the parameter to see which one is generating the best value for you.   Classmates have done looping, hit and trial method etc to get the desired results.    These posts can also be relevant for you #664 #480 #667  To calculate the p-value see if you can use python and does that make any difference. Although difference should be negligible if you are doing right using R or Python provided if it is being done the right way.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: My problem is using math.log incorrectly, just in case anybody needs this info. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I got the similar numbers. How did you know your implementation is not correct? Did you get some errors in the output? You may put some pictures here.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also got the same error initially even though I thought what I did was correct. Try debugging your formula you implemented for inl2. Mine was related to syntax for math.log(xyz,2) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: My error is discovering in the error message on livedata saying math did not have log2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may change to math.log(x, 2) instead 
THREAD: MP2.2 clarification questions REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For question 2: c() is a count function, so c(t, Q) is the total occurrences of the term t in the query Q. Same idea for the rest of the c() listed in question 3.   the values can be obtained by using sd.X where X is the attribute found in this file (refer to the comment above the line): https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/score_data.h  EDIT: remember you are only working on one term at a time. the ranker formula should be written as such and the rest of the provided code performs the iterations so that all the terms are passed through  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please find the inline answers to the best of my knowledge:  Does "term" mean every single word except stop words in query and doc?  ---> Term and word are synonyms here, including Stop words as user might use stop words as well in the query. The stop words are handled by the model separately (HINT: stopword.txt).  Does c(t, Q) mean how many times t(this term) show up in Q? ----> Count of each terms in the Query  How to obtain these three values? Is there a name for that approach. ---> The Score_data or sd is used to obtain these values  (HINT: sd.<property>). (Refer the Link given for sd in the ReadMe)  c(t,Q)：Total number of terms in the Query.  ---> No, Its the count of each term in the Query c(t,C)：Corpus term count. ---->- No, Its the count of each term in the Corpus / Collection / text corpus (check text_Corpus wiki for details) c(t,D)：Total number of terms in the document.  ----> Count of each term in the document.  Is the parameter sd in score_one(self, sd) the idx (idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index(cfg)?  ---> No, sd or Score data is a separate attribute which comes along with metapy library.) it can be accessed using sd.<property>.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Term means each word in the query.  c() means frequency which is count or number of times that term appeared.  c(t, Q) --> Number of times the term appears in the query c(t, D) --> Number of times the term appears in the current doc c(t, C) --> Number of times the term appears in corpus  `sd` parameter in `score_one()` is the score_data object from where you can access the corresponding variables for c(t, Q), c(t, C) etc. The content of `score_data` object can be found here: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/score_data.h. Use those variables to replace your c(t, C), C(t, Q) etc. in the formula. Try to find if you find a variable that gives you c(t, Q) in the score_data object. See the comment for each variable in the score_data object and you will find a match. Once you find a match you can access them in your code as `sd.<variable>`.  Good luck 
THREAD: MP2.4 Leader board- what is the last 0/1 column? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, It looks like the result does not beat the baseline. So please try to get the 1 in the last column. Please refer to #483. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1 -- means you met the basic requirements 0 -- means you still need to fix something  To get a bonus, you need to at top 50 .... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: "To get a bonus, you need to at top 50 ...." I missed this part. Where does it say this on the syllabus (?) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 0 means you submitted but it failed. You have to get 1 for success and receive grade.   Additionally you can be in the top 50 in the leaderboard to get bonus points.  However, top 50 in leaderboard and bonus point is only applicable for MP2.4.  For more details, see: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.4#bonus-top-ranked-in-search-competition-leaderboard REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I thought you meant there are bonus points for every assignment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No. the bonus point is only meant for MP2.4 competition task.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Would the Rank be based on the Overall Score or like the way its now i.e based on the one of the dataset ?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks!

THREAD: MP2.2 Also not sure how to start REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I was having the same issue before. I solved it by installing the Anaconda and created a virtual environment for running the scripts and commands. Here is how I do it in OSX: ``` conda create --name cs410 python=3.5 conda activate cs410 ``` And then you can try using pip to install the metapy. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also for how to start this MP, I find this post very useful. #699  I hope this can help you get started. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Regarding the metapy. I am using python 2.7 and pip install. Others are using conda, but python2.7 has worked for me like charm.  If you resolve this metapy error. I have tried to suggest few steps (without stating the obvious answer). Please take a look and let me know if you still have issues.  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Create a virtual environment (either python 2.7 or python 3.5). Similarly how you did your MP1. If you have the environment of MP1, you can use the same environment.   Regarding the assignment execution, first clone the repo following the MP setup instructions on week1 (like how you did MP1/MP2.1).   Then run the program on your environment as  ``` python search_eval config.toml ``` or  ``` python3 search_eval config.toml ``` depending what python you are using.  And then modify the `score_one()` function to implement InL2 formula. No need to worry about the summation portion. It will be taken care of by the program automatically. And also modify `load_ranker()` to call `InL2Ranker` instance. Once you achieve this, follow the instruction on `Varying InL2’s parameter` and `Statistical significance testing` for final requirements for grading.  Good luck. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I looked at #699 previously, but I still feel like it didn't help me at all (I don't feel like I'm at the same part of the project as 699 was).   How do you create the environment in Anaconda again? Am I supposed to be running the Anaconda terminal in the MP2.2_private folder? Can I just create a random new one to run the commands? Can I just use the one I used for MP1? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: How did you use Python 2.7? I checked my Python version on Pycharm and it said it was 3.8. I think I can create a Python 2.7 environment using Anaconda, but I do not really know how I would exactly go about accomplishing that. Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I don't recall exactly how I created the virtual environment in MP1 (I think I used Anaconda? Or is the virtual environment supposed to be Pycharm? Or can the virtual environment be both?)  I did clone MP2.2 already into the MP2.2_private folder, and as shown in the screenshots in the post, I've ran both "python search_eval config.toml" and "python3 search_eval config.toml", but the python3 one didn't work and the python one is getting me the error shown in the screenshot.  I'm still not quite clear about what modifying the score_one() function means. In search_eval.py, it says in the comments section for score_one() that "You need to override this function to return a score for a single term", so do I modify the existing score_one() in search_eval.py? Or do I override the score_one() elsewhere separately in search_eval.py and not touch the original score_one()? Or do I create a new Python file to write the code where I override/modify score_one()? The same questions for load_ranker() as well.  Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for answering. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: if you know how to use a venv (virtual environment) then you can have a separate python 2.7 installation. But if not, then you can always install a Python 2.7 version (separate from conda). That's what I did. Below is the python org link.   https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/  Once done, use pip install to install metapy under python 2.7. and use python instead of python3 to execute the scripts for all the MPs REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've tried installing Python for MP1 and worked on it extensively with someone else (I believe they were a TA), and ultimately we couldn't figure it out, installing Python did not work for my PC for some reason. Thanks for answering though. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Can you try using the below command?  pip install metapy==0.2.13 pytoml  The python 2.7 is not compatible with the default (recent) version of metapy. So I had to install an older version. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have used anaconda in MP1.  Try this and this should work ``` conda env list ``` If it lists the environment, the using the below command you can switch to your desired environment ``` conda activate <env from the above list> ```  you can also see you current python version using  ``` python --version python3 --version ``` whatever you are using it should be 2.7 or 3.5 for your MP2.2  Forget about override the function. Just comment the existing return and implement the formula in that function and return the new result. That's it.      REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried using that command, but it got me the same errors in red as the red errors that are in my first two screenshots of the post. Didn't seem to work, unfortunately. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I was able to switch to my desired environment on Anaconda, so thanks for the tips! I was also able to see my current Python version (3.5.6).  I've already cloned my MP2.2 on PyCharm, though, so I'm worried that I might run into duplicate problems if I clone MP2.2 again (this time on the Anaconda terminal). Should I clone MP2.2 again? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I met the similar question at the beginning of this class. What I did:  1. Download 'Anaconda'  2. Open 'Anaconda Prompt' and create a  new environment with python = 3.7 by:            ```conda create -n myenv python=3.7``` note: ```myenv ``` is the file's name (e.g. mine is python3.7) 3. Activate python3.7 with:      ``` conda activate python3.7``` 4. install libs by pip:    ``` pip install metapy pytoml``` 5. Open VSCode and select the python version I created (I only use VSCode, so not sure about other tools): ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/74bc3e63-14cd-47c9-a112-8aef49d2c136/image.png) So far so good. Hope it works for you. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: from your conda python environment.... you can go to any location and run the program so yes, you can use your existing clone. Just go to that directory and run ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` and you should see the output.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This worked, thanks!

THREAD: MP 2.2 Invalid File Error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I was having the same issue. Make sure your script and config.toml file are located in the same folder & that you are executing from there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The original program used `config.toml` as the argument. you can keep that portion as is and if using python command line just the run the program as  ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` That would be it.   But if using jupyter notebook, then probably mention the file inside the code.

THREAD: How to write to significance.txt REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try incorporating the parameter here when running the script. **python search_eval.py config.toml** REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: All u need to do is write to a file when u calculate the avg_p value, so place a code which writes the contents to the file.  Something like:  ```  print('Running queries')     with open("bm25.avg_p.txt","w") as f:                 ...........other code ...........                 f.write(str(avg_p)+"\n")     print("Closing file") ```  change the file name when u run the Iln2 ranking function code.  Once you have both files, run code separately that generates float arrays and use scipy.stats.ttest_rel for generating the p value. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: first you need to tackle the load_ranker function. If you are yet to implement the InL2 ranker, then lets do that 1st.  I have tried to explain the steps to someone on this POST.  https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/768 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you have to create both the files.  a. `bm25.avg_p.txt` containing all the avg_p values for bm25 algo b. `inl2.avg_p.txt` containing all the avg_p values for inl2 algo  You can create these two files while recording the p values in the program itself. There are many ways to write data in file. I am sure you will figure that out.    Once you create these files, the README explains different approaches using R or using python to use the data from both files  to generate the `significance.txt` file. Remember to write only the floating value in the  ``significance.txt` file and no scientific notation value. Good luck.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm getting the results in my terminal but when I try to write to the files, only the last avg_p is there. I wasn't able to write to a new line each time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This was super helpful, thank you! 
THREAD: Cannot create the index file REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is your Ubuntu running as a VM ?  This generally happens when you run out of memory for the filesystem. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it was running as a vagrant vm, but not sure if that is the memory issue. It was given enough memory (8GB RAM, 40GB HDD). Same thing runs fluently on a cloud VM with very low resource (614MB RAM, 10GB HDD), so I am continuing the work there. Probably something else is wrong with my system settings. Thanks for the reply. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Change your working directory to point to the folder where config.toml is present REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Working directory was right and the commands were run from the folder where the `config.toml` file was present. I did try with a python script in the same directory too, but same thing happened.  It's working in same setup on a Cloud VM with limited resource. I am going to use that for solving this MP, and may be debug the system issue later. Thanks for the response though. 
THREAD: Should I run the search_eval.py in this way?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No I am running on terminal, do you have any IDE to recommend so that I can change the python version? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you are running on the terminal and have python3.5 installed then run python3.5 search_eval.py config.toml Also if with 3.5 you don't have metapy then before the above command type pip3.5 install metapy pytoml  Also for python I always prefer pycharm  
THREAD: MP2.2 don't know where to start REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Start by implementing the given InL2 equation in the score_one function.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you have cloned the Repo. I would suggest 1st run the search_eval.py with an argument config.toml. This will give you an idea what it is currently doing.  As you might have read that this assignment needs 2 parts to submit.  PART 1: The initial code implements one of the ranking functions - without a parameter. this code is implemented using the imported metapy library (refer the load_ranker function)  Now about the InL2 function and score and the whole Readme function.  if you have gone through the given images - ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b7d68c07-adeb-4e19-85cb-a11229586a5e/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fb6d2e03-59ec-49e1-87da-6f1faeb9b9ef/image.png)  then you just need to implement (convert) the formula inside the SUMMATION into code (HINT: you would need math.log). The rest of the python code (already given) takes care of the summation for you.  Now to convert the 2 above functions. you need to use SOURCE_DATA or sd library (also part of metapy, already imported). To view what sd library holds, there is a link given. Follow that for to look up the various properties given in it.  HINT: sd.<property> will give you the required values of the various properties.   PART 2: Let me know once you complete the PART 1, I will explain the Part 2.   Let me know in case of any issues REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #680  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Implement the score function (test it in another notebook) - only the part *inside* the summation. 2. Run the script (which prints a list of average precision) - once for a standard ranker, once for your inl2 ranker - append these values in lists and run the scipy function for statistical inference. Paste p value in *significance.txt* REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Part 2: This step is really very trivial but tricky. It needs to be done by creating a separate .py file and using scipy library.  To start with, write the avg precisions from InL2 and another selected (any one of the 5-6 ranker fundtions), into a text file (HINT: newline separated). Then use those 2 text files and read them in THAT scipy script as lists. (HINT: str to float).  There is link provided in the Readme for the scipy usage. Make sure you read that.  Let me know if that takes you somewhere. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Kushagra, how would I do c(t,D) and c(t,Q)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Hi Vedant, c(t,D) is Document term count i.e. number of times a term appears in the document. c(t,Q) - is the number of times a term appears in the query.  You should find these description in the sd link.  (HINT: sd.<property>) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, Thank you! I understood it much better :) Thanks again for your help!

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: bm25.avg_p.txt and inl2.avg_p.txt should not have any text but should only be floats. Only then scipy can generate p value.  Also,  you do not have to submit scipy code therefore you can remove the text manually from the .txt files by Find -> Replace.   two things" you have to submit: 1.

THREAD: MP2.3 Released 
THREAD: Statistical Significance Testing of 5% REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is not necessary that you will get p value below 5%. This is because even BM25 function is pretty efficient.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: we aim that they are same, but if the p < 5%, we reject our assumption, so conclude that they are different. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Alternatively, try to maximize the InL2 MAP and make it as close match as it can be with BM25.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Our aim is to reduce the difference between the Ln2 MAP and BM25 MAP and make them close.  Statistical test is to further ensure whether this reduction is statistically sigificant or not occured by a random chance.  A p value less than 5% means there is only less than 5% chance that the observed similarity is due to random occurence. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In a simpler terms, we want to test that whether the MAP calculated by 2 different rank functions are significantly different or not. I compared the InL2 ranker with BM25 and DirichletPrior. Below are my findings - The dirichlet vs Inl2 has a p-value = 0.39... while the BM25 vs InL2 has p-value = 0.044  This tells that the BM25 and Inl2 rankers have significant difference in their calculated Avg precisions and there is 4.4 % chance that it is due to randon fluctuations. (As We know BM25 is a pretty efficient)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: so, what does this conclude? The InL2 is better than Dirichlet as it has 4.4% vs. Dirichlet 's 39%? I wanted to understand what is the take away or 'to do next' after a significance test. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the take away here is MAP value of lnL2 is quite comparable with the output of BM25 ranker but not so with DirichletPrior.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Smaller p-values signify that the difference between the two things being compared is statistically significant.  5% is just a random threshold.

THREAD: MP2.2.stuck REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: What are the versions you get when you do `python --version` `python3 --version`  Also, try running the same program as ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please check this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32680081/importerror-after-successful-pip-installation. Also, to avoid such issues in the future, you may start using conda to set up the environment for each project.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It looks like you are using pip to install the metapy but using python3 to execute it. pip will install the libraries to python2X while pip3 installs them to python3X.  Also, additionally metapy seems to be working fine with python 2.7 (for me atleast). So its better to use pip and python together.. not pip and python3...   try executing your script using python2.7  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: adding config.toml fixed it, thanks

THREAD: Question about smoothing methods REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think this will never happen. The collection LM should cover all already?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have the same question. What if a query term is neither in the document nor in the collection LM? Is there an underlying assumption that the collection LM covers all the possible query terms? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The Collections / Corpus / Text corpus are considered as the resource pool for linguistics based research.  So, Its ok to say that they SHOULD contain all the terms. more details can be found on this wiki  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Same collection LM might not be optimal for all queries as the unseen words will always have same probabilities. May be we have more in upcoming weekly chapters.

THREAD: MP2.2 Statistical significance testing  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: What I did is I read the files and put the values in two separate float lists, ```bm25``` and ```inl2```. Then I run ```stats.ttest_rel(bm25, inl2)``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try to input queries as arrays rather than the path to the files! ( Also make sure the arrays are floats!) Here is the documentation for scipy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Have you removed all the text from the file. I guess you have text in the file while you just need numbers as input for your function.   You can remove all the text by doing Find and Replace in your text files. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I got the same error, even after turning my .txt files into arrays of length 225. I'm still puzzling it out.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, I figured it out - the values in the array were saved as strings and I needed to change them to floats. Hope this helps someone! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ``` After converting the data into float arrays it worked ```  **One other question here, for both ranking functions which params I should use, for Iln2 I used param where I'm getting max MAP. But how about bm25, should I do the same??** REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For BM25 we also need to experiment with different parameter values (k1, b, k3)  to find an "optimal" ranking function with maximum possible MAP. Then the statistical significance test is carried out by comparing the AP (average precision) values from your optimal InL2 and your optimal BM25 ranker. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Convert the Values into Float while reading them as List. Then pass those lists to the scipy.stats.  Also, make sure you are passing ONLY the Average Precision Values while writing the files. you can write the values along with Newline. (the newline can be removed while reading using list.splitlines())  I was facing the same issue. This resolved it.

THREAD: Unable to use numpy on MP2.2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can actually copy the printed output in .txt and submit.   Your code for submission should only update score_one and ranking_score and nothing else. Even calculation for t test should be done outside and should not be part of the submitted program.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may do not use sd.* correctly. Double confirm the api and the formula REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Explore with the parameters to maximize your Mean average (0.20 seems low).. if your formula implementation is correct (you can revisit your implementation to make sure it is correct), then it is just playing with the parameters.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Have you used correct parameters for each of the variable in the formula. e.g. quite a few of us got confused with |D| - it should be sd.doc_size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: When you submit your search_eval.py, make sure that you have only modified the score_one and load_ranker functions. I got a "not implemented correctly" when I changed the default value of some_param in the InL2Ranker class constructor. Things were fine after I changed the default back to 1.0. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think so...thanks let me double check even tho I checked before REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: i kind of automated the process of getting the max mean precision val - map. I created a copy of the whole search_eval.py  Then I created a custom function find_max_map(map) in it which takes the average precision value.   Also, passed the parameter directly to load_ranker function.  Then i moved the whole avg_p calculation section preset in the main, inside a WHILE loop, and kept increasing the parameter (passed to load_ranker) values by 1 or 10. (played around with it for sometime to get the MAX value based on the parameter. noticed that for the dirichletprior the values was increasing and decresing for a wide range untill 209)  The idea is to pass the map val and keep a track of max map value.  I added a self stopping algo to it but if you don 't want to complicate it, just Ctl+C when you think there is No Max Mean getting calculated after many iterations of parameter increament.  Let me know if you want the max finder function. 
THREAD: Anyone tackle MP3 yet? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Heard MP3 is the most challenging of all assignments. In slack you can search MP3 in the TIS channel to get some hints on the problems previous batch students faced.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: I found the lecture slides very helpful.  They show the formulas for updating the matrices in each step.   You just have to implement them into code, which is pretty straightforward once you grasp what the terms in the formulas are/which matrices they correspond to.  The readme.md file also contains a good explanation of the matrices that I found helpful.  My suggestion regarding for loop vs matrix operations: Dont get too fixated on which; just go with whichever is easiest for you to get started.   As you work through the code, your brain will start putting pieces together or direct you to find clarifications on specific things.  Although my solution uses matrix operations, it took me a while to wrap my head around them and to grasp numpy's powerful (and cool!) broadcasting capability.  I think it adds an extra level of complexity (depending on your familiarity with numpy) that's not necessary for a working implementation (for the test dataset, anyways).   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: @David, Can you share your MP3 experience as well if you have already completed?  :)  And any special tips. Planning to start MP3.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. I think the most important thing to keep in mind at every step is: what are the input and output matrices and dimensions?  There are only so many ways of combining these things that mathematically work.  I think half of the challenge is not getting lost in corpus/document/topic keywords - it's hard to keep all the matrices from blending together in your brain. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you David. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi Zhou, when you talking about slides, do you mean lecture videos of 9.7 and 9.8? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's the one, the set of slides on PLSA.  The formulas you need to implement are near the end. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm little confused on what is expected to be print out for the iteration loop. Could you help clarify this? 
THREAD: Why the ranker.score(idx, query, num_results)  hangs ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It looks like you are running this in a jupyter notebook.  We need more information... I would print out idx, query, num_results, ranker under the "for" line and make sure all the variables are sane. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use an IDE to debug instead of notebook. It will be much easier. Alternatively, you can try to add a print statement before ranker.score and see what value of idx, query and num_results it is hanging.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As soon as I place the ranker statement, this things hangs indefinetly, can it be because of the Python version ?  I have printed the idx & the Query. In the last for loop where I have commented everything, the print statement "Coming" shows, however the for loop (2nd last one) doesn't show the print statement ("Coming") even if it is before the ranker.score and it hangs !!  Note: I haven't change anything as of yet, just trying to run and see what's available in the README.md     ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/96826fb1-a253-45b4-89b5-d3a96adcecf4/image.png)    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Any print statement put, it's not printing at all, as soon as the ranker.score is being added up. Any suggestion ! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: metapy runs best on python version 2.7 or 3.5. Yours seems to be 3.7. (based on your python version print)   Try downgrading to python3.5.  Also make sure the files are being read by your programs. If you launching notebook from the code directory should be fine but if launched from other locations likely the file path needs modifications too... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is better to use an IDE, so that you can debugging and locate exactly which line inside the library is hanging. And going forward, IDE will save you time. I am using Intellij by the way, but any IDE will be fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Better use the other rankers (as sggested in the ReadMe). The other rankers take only 1 parameter, which is easier to follow and get an idea what exactly is needed as part of this assignment.  It is tricky to read the readme but once you get it its easy. 
THREAD: MP2.2 breaking down the scoring function REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You have to click the Get Access and follow the steps read the full  paper in that link.  Alternatively, I have searched the paper ttitle in google and found the entire paper without sign in on another website, Check this out: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.8274&rep=rep1&type=pdf  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Let me try to explain Question 2. "cranfield-qrels.txt" has three columns, which should represent Query ID, Document ID, and Gain. A higher gain indicates that the document is more relevant to the query, based on actual relevance judgements.   In this assignment, we are trying to evaluate the performance of the ranker, i.e., we want to see if the ranker could generate a higher score to a more relevant document and rank more relevant documents to the top. The scoring/ranking function is used by the ranker to calculate a score for a given query and document.  After the ranker pulls out the list of top ranked documents for a given query, Average Precision (which is an important ranker performance indicator) is then calculated with reference to the actual relevance score in "cranfield-qrels.txt". 
THREAD: MP2.2 How to calculate |D|?

Is there something wrong with my understanding? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes no of terms in the document is length REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: |D| is sd.doc_size. There's also the sd.unique_terms variable, which is probably what you were thinking but isn't what you want for the ranker equation.

THREAD: Do we use have to use metapy for future homework REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: MP2.4 is extended version of MP2.2.  MP3 also I heard we need metapy.  So I believe yes, metapy is still needed.    Btw.. metapy runs best on `Python2.7` or `Python3.5`. So if you have any of this two python version you will less likely encounter metapy installation issues.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will need to install Metapy. In case you want to refer the "How to" #106  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks but there a particular reason why we use this package?   There are many packages out there like nltk that are much more used in industry  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It seems like it will be needed for most of the MPs. I have it installed on a Py 2.7 environment and that has worked well for assignments so far.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: nltk is more of an NLP package than text retrieval. i mean this is kind of like asking why would I implement data structures in a ds&a class instead of using a package? because the purpose is to learn how things work. Not the biggest fan of the metapy docs myself, but the minimal feature set has its purposes  And to be frank, while the experience with installing metapy is clearly not ideal, we are CS grad students.. being able to manage a python environment and install one package should absolutely be one of our skills REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Use conda - smooth and keeps your native installations of Python separate. Whatever packages you install on conda stay there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Could not agree more, spend quite a lot of time initially to just make it installed and this does not seem to be industry standard library as well  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have the same idea. It seems that the Metapy guarantees to work under Python 3.5 and 2.7 only. I tested other Python versions but encountered some errors during the installation phase.  If you have enough knowledge and time, you can fix them by yourself, but I believe using the guaranteed Python version is the most efficient for our assignments. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You can use conda to create a separate environment. I use the following environment, which works smoothly so far(it is python 3.6). You can check the conda documentation for further information.  `environment-python36.yml` ``` # conda env update -f environment-python36.yml --prune # conda env create -f environment-python36.yml # conda remove --name environment-python36 --all name: cs410-tis-python36 channels:   - pytorch   - defaults dependencies:   - pip=21.0.1   - python=3.6   - Cython   - pip:     - --requirement requirements-python36.txt ```  You can specify fixed versions for the following if you want. requirements-python36.txt ``` numpy pandas jupyterlab bs4 selenium webdriver_manager metapy pytoml sklearn ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks guys the package works w python v 3.7! 
THREAD: MP2.2 Formula Implementation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you just have to implement the two formulae given in the git readme - tfn and score - nothing else. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You only need to implement the following functions: def score_one(self, sd): def load_ranker(cfg_file):  Implement these two formulas in the first function. This is only per term. The model will sum all together. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is a little confusing, but score_one() expects you to implement the score(term, document) portion of the larger equation that includes the summation, which would be score(query, document). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Just the `score_one` function and the `load_ranker` function. You can keep the remaining portion of the program as is. The summation will be done for you by the program itself (the `ranker.score()` function will internally call `score_one()` and do the summation).  Searching `MP2.2 ` in the campuswire you will also find similar question answered and tips too.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You don’t need to do summation. It is automatically habdled REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: There is no need to create or use a summation function. The only functions that should be implemented are def score_one(self, sd) and def load_ranker(cfg_file). Everything else has already been taken care of. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For the summation query, kindly refer to https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/641   for calculating the individual score, just follow the formula given to calculate the score.

Coursera week 6 also has a video `Summary for Exam 1` that can be referred. https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/9CAed/lesson-6-10-summary-for-exam-1 5. Office hours is also a good place to take more input from TAs and Prof Zhai.   6. Last but not least, Exam Guide is generally released by instructors (i think couple of weeks in  advance) which can be used as reference preparation guide.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Every week's overview is much important also.  Like https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/0wyle/week-3-overview 
THREAD: MP 2.3 - submission date REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The deadline won't be changed. Since MP2.3 is based on the previous MPs, it will be released after the deadline for MP2.2. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: what's the deadline for MP2.2? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This weekend it seems and if so, MP 2.3 will be released sometimes mid of next week with less than a week deadline to complete , this is quite aggressive schedule even if the MP is simple   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: On the other hand, Coursera shows the expected time for MP 2.3 as 30 minutes instead of 4 hours. (crosses fingers) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Indeed its a max 30 mnts exercise to be honest, thanks !!  
THREAD: Week4 Quiz5  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Take a look at the likelihood function and two smoothing functions. If word count for every term doubles in one document, both the word counts and document length will double.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: In JM Model,  c(w,d)/|d| remains constant in case you double the terms and the second parameter is constant i.e it does not depend on document length whereas in DP model the second parameter depends on the document length and hence p(w|d) remains same in case of JM smoothing . Hope this helps !!    
THREAD: Prof. Zhai's Office hour recordings? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hello TAs, any update on this? If Prof.'s OH recordings are not going to be posted we my have to plan to attend in person. I am not in CT and an overseas student so, may need to plan my schedule accordingly. Please let me know. Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This post might answer your question as well. #893  
THREAD: MP 2.2 Leadership score 1 means full grade on both the parameters REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please check your settings in github/leadership board. If it's not graded in Coursera don't assume that it's graded.  For the safe side, drop a mail to TA(s) so that you don't face any late penalty REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If you see score as 1 in livedatalab, it should be graded in full, but if you don't see in coursera, it's something wrong between coursera & livedatalab. You may check the webhook on github repo or click the "Open Tool" button from Coursera at least one and re-commit the changes to see your score in Coursera.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for this answer.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Make sure that you've opened LiveDataLab from the 'Open Tool' link on this assignment's Coursera page at least once. 
THREAD: MP2.2 What is the difference between N and |D| REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: N is the number of docs and |D| is the doc size. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: N - Total number of documents in the collection |D| - Doc size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: to elaborate a bit, |D| is doc size as in length of document (# of terms) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks 
THREAD: MP2.2 Ranking Evaluation Thought REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Typically you want to reject a null hypothesis to prove your alternate hypothesis is better than it. It's not very meaningful to pick a too weak null hypothesis as the baseline(e.g. the random ranker), comparing to selecting a robust, effective ranker like BM25. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sure, our null hypothesis here is that there's no significant difference in the average precision measurements between BM25 and I(n)L2. I get that and the fact that we can take BM25 as a known quantity. My question was more one of, would this be a valid method to naively--without comparing against an existing, validated ranking function--evaluate a novel ranking function? I may just give it a try with the various Meta built in ranking functions and edify myself.  Thanks for the response, btw. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: And to no one's surprise, the known ranking functions evaluate very well against a random ranker, although I only looked at topK=10 document selection. 
THREAD: Access methods and properties of metapy.index.RankingFunction REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Actually,  you do not need to know this base class. You only need to override score_one().  It is much important for you to know is a score_data sd object, from which you can get whatever you need to implement the formula provided in this assignment.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: - [Okapi BM25](https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/okapi_bm25.h), method = "**bm25**"  - [Pivoted Length Normalization](https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/pivoted_length.h), method = "**pivoted-length**" - [Absolute Discount Smoothing](https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/absolute_discount.h), method = "**absolute-discount**" - [Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing](https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/jelinek_mercer.h), method = "**jelinek-mercer**" - [Dirichlet Prior Smoothing](https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/dirichlet_prior.h), method = "**dirichlet-prior**"  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You don't need to know the details of RankingFunction. It is most written in c++, if you want to know. It is wrapping the loop and you only need to know how to implement scoring a single term. The outer loop will sum your term score. You just follow the formula given with sd properties and everything should be fine. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's the ranker class in Meta: https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/master/include/meta/index/ranker/ranker.h C++ as otherwise noted, but useful. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Here's the example on how to implement a `RankingFunction`.  https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/examples/query_runner.py  In this MP, we need to focus on variables of score_data `sd` object which can be obtained from below documentation.  https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html 
THREAD: Mp2.2 clarification REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "cfg" is just "config.toml", the first argument to search_eval.py when you call it.  About your script hanging, just checking the obvious stuff: * In the same folder as your script, are there cranfield-qrels.txt and cranfield-queries.txt files?  * Is there a "cranfield" subfolder with cranfield.dat, line.toml and (optionally, I think) README.md? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am having the same problem with the script hanging, and double-checked that all those files you have mentioned are there. Any other suggestions? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont want to state the obvious, but please stick to the folder structure and guidelines. also, many of the issues faced are basic python issues.  now, to help you, and others, especially for 2.2, it would be immensely helpful if you can paste the folder structure, the command line snapshot (so we can see where you are running it), the content of your config.toml and the search script python code. it is a matter of barely minutes after that. right now, we are just answering based on guesses. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm running the  ``` python3 search_eval.py config.toml ```  command in the root of the repo, where all other files are. Can you point me to the folder structure in the instructions we are supposed to run this command? I don't even see a getting started section for this particular mp. Diving in the deep end here! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you are supposed to run it in the root folder of the assignment. that being said, technically you can run it anywhere provided, the first parameter you are giving correctly points to a configuration file. if you give only config.toml it assumes it is in the same folder. also if you look at the config.toml, you would see it points to certain directories.  That being said, I am not sure how you are getting the output  "Query path!! cranfield-queries.txt"  it is not printed anywhere in the python code. for me, I just get Building or loading index... Running queries Query 1 average precision: 0.2816666666666666 .... and so on for every query (and in the end)  Mean average precision: 0.22746739173035468  copy the code which you are running, then I can comment. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I added “query path” as debug remnants to ensure the loop is working correctly REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As mentioned, it gets stuck first iteration. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I cant give any meaningful suggestion without looking at the code of the loop. for example, your 0 should never be printed in the default code, so you added some more debug prints probably. if you can share the loop code, we can see whats going on. else, it is very hard to point whats the issue.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sure, I added the print statements to verify the code was entering the for loop. Seems like it is, but if you think these statements should be removed, I can remove no problem.   My lines are added in red.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Wondering if I should try an engineering UUIC machine? Where can I access that again? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: ok, your main code is fine. the problem could be in the load_ranker.  the default given in the code read this:  return metapy.index.JelinekMercer()  I hope you changed it to something meaningful with a parameter - could you paste that part too. Did you try with different rankers?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Which version of python you are using? It works with python 2.7. I had the same issue on my mac with python 3.7. It works fine after switching over to 2.7  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am using 3.5 in conda. I think for all meta related coding, you have to use either of those versions as specified in the setup. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Interesting! You are right. So I was using 3.7 too, noticed that behavior! I then installed pyenv, installed python 3.5, then ran the code, and the code executed in microseconds.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One more help.. so we are implementing this function. Am I right? https://camo.githubusercontent.com/39f4e54dd1dd643e9a44a8957760308cb3550cd36fbb99f5db025e7fb5632f0a/68747470733a2f2f64726976652e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f75633f6578706f72743d766965772669643d3167636279774c78305a4555336571786c44744c6b366f3459786437383849694b  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I dont have access to the doc. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try now, for the requirement of "Implementing the InL2 parameter correctly -- 0.7 (70) points" was wondering if this part of the equation is what we will be graded on https://camo.githubusercontent.com/39f4e54dd1dd643e9a44a8957760308cb3550cd36fbb99f5db025e7fb5632f0a/68747470733a2f2f64726976652e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f75633f6578706f72743d766965772669643d3167636279774c78305a4555336571786c44744c6b366f3459786437383849694b REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: you have to implement both - first calculate tfn, then use another equation for the score in which tfn would be an input. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. I think the end goal of this project is to compare two retrieval functions: ln2L2 and BM25.  2. You can modify the main function in the script "search_eval.py" and manually hard code the file name ("config.toml") in. Or you can pass the file name through the command line (like what u did). I personally prefer the first method.  Also as Slok Kumar said, please notice the relative position between the file "config.toml" and the script "search_eval.py" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think someone pointed out that their python version is incorrect (has to be 3.5 or 2.7) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: 1. Yes. We need to implement score_one function andCall the InL2 ranker by editing the return statement of load_ranker function inside search_eval.py. 2. I think you are using python version >= 3.7. Try using version <=3.6  `cfg` is used to get the query, score and compute the average precision for BM25 and InL2 which is required to calculate the significance.txt (second goal of the assignment)   
THREAD: Lesson 4.3: "presidential campaign update" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: you have a point there. But I would think it would be document model approach + additional approach (to cover the NLP part). I say this since as you pointed out yourself, some users might be looking for the exact term in the name or document.  I guess thats the whole point - good or bad of the document model. you are looking for terms, or the presence of terms, with some additional subtleties.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Some of these systems use synonyms to look up terms as well (e.g., WordNet) 
THREAD: Some Important Facts for MP2.2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thank you for sharing! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is a helpful post, thanks.  I had the same import issue as your third post. I had to **remove** any mention of **scipy** and **numpy** from my search_eval.py code.  I have a couple things to add:  4.   If you're having trouble with mapping the parameters in the InL2 function to the score_data object, try reviewing the notation used in **Lesson 2.2**. 5.   As mentioned in post #262, |D| represents the total number of **terms** in the document REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Good notes, thanks for sharing !!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Probably better to create a separate jupyter notebook and run your custom ranker experiments there. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for sharing! 
THREAD: MP 2.2: which ranker to compare with InL2? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: For the submission of the first part you need to build your own ranker which is InL2 custom function where you need to write the equivalence of the formula given. The BM25 comparison is for the second part where you need to get the average using your ranker you built before and then get the average using BM25, write it to 2 different files (your ranker average in one file and BM25 to another) and then print the difference from the 2 files in significance.txt. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you. Do you know why MP 2.2 asks us to try something besides BM25+k3 in the "Varying a parameter" section? Is that just to get us acquainted with optimizing parameters? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Well when you write your custom ranker you still need to run comparisons with another ranker to show your custom ranker accuracy. There I have used Dirichlet as they suggested to use something other than bm25. So in summary use something other than bm25 to evaluate your ranker. Then while submitting significance.txt compare your ranker with bm25. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think another reason could be: BM25 has 3 parameters, others have 1 - so its easy to see how changing the parameters could affect the MAP (for other algos). also, the slow changing nature of the MAP value in BM25 could be little boring. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The purpose of this exercise is how MAP value is changing . Since BM25 has 3 parameters , you can have a 3 cascaded while loop and changing the k1, k2 and k3 and do a plot on MAP value ...  
THREAD: MP2.2 ZeroDivisionError REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: what value of c are you using? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just c = 1 for now while I test the function. What does |D| represent? Perhaps I misunderstood its meaning and that could be the cause.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/43cb0cd1-8806-4cde-b675-b5e06b7b43b3/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: |D| - doc_size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: womp there it is. thanks 
THREAD: MP2.2 what does self.param in search_eval.py  represents in InL2 function provided kn read.me? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: self represents the instance of the class and is always pointing to the current object. so when in the constructor it does self.param = some_param, it initializes the param variable with the value passed when creating the object for the class  in main.  You can also refer to https://www.programiz.com/article/python-self-why for a detailed explaination REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok.what does self.param represents in InL2 function provided in readme? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: When using InL2, self.param will be the **c** hyperparameter, which modifies the weight of the document length normalization in the **tfn** portion of the equation. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: it represents a variable within the class/object - you initialize it to the value passed as parameter. it is a common coding practice.  specifically for Ln2, if you see the formula for score, you would see there is a "+ c" in the denominator. The param is for that part. 
THREAD: InL2 not implemented correctly MP2.2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Did you do the implementation in the score_one function provided? Did you implement score_one to process a single term of the query? I have seen the AG output go from 'InL2 not implemented correctly' before implementing the function to passing after implementing it, so I believe it is working correctly. You could try printing the average precision returned by your ranker for a given query and document, then manually computing it to see if they match. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I've passed the significance and got the 0.3 points but still cannot pass the InL2 test, dude could u plz run locally "python3.5 search_eval.py config.toml" and check whether you also got the value of mean average precision as 0.2396277693793? I am just so curious about what AG is testing for and what is exactly the error instead of just telling "inL2 not working properly", it's too vague..... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The value I get for MAP is > 0.255. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Alright I just re-start from scratch and retrieve I have prior. Finally, when I implemented the code as simply as possible without making any changes to other files or create any other files, It just magically passed.   Some suggestions: 1. do not make change to any other files, like create other py scripts or txts not needed(previously I created inl2.txt and bm25.txt and another py scripts for calculating the diff, also when you run it locally it would produce a fold called idx and with a lot of binary files inside: I don't whether that would influence the running of AG or not since there's very limited err msg given out when AG's done) 2. only make changes in score-one function and call inl2 constructor in load_ranker without changing others. I've changed some parts of main to write into txt files for later significance test processing, this might interfere with the AG process 3. dont worry about the truncations or whatever things like the difference of types while doing calculations, I believe py would handle those stuff for u. eg. when you do int. + float,  I think py would defaultly convert all. stuff to float to save as much of data as you wanted. Just to make the calculation of single score as clear-cut as possible according to the formula in read_me REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: <<1. do not make change to any other files, like create other py scripts or txts not needed(previously I created inl2.txt and bm25.txt and another py scripts for calculating the diff, also when you run it locally it would produce a fold called idx and with a lot of binary files inside: I don't whether that would influence the running of AG or not since there's very limited err msg given out when AG's done) >>  That would not affect the evaluation. you need the text score files to calculate the difference, and some sort of script to do the actual comparison (I created a 10 line python script separately). they were present in my git folders when I submitted.  The idx folder would not influence the running.  In general, I agree with the spirit of the your message - keep it simple. but you have to overwrite certain parts to produce the temporary output files required for the result. Can't go into the coding nuisance for that part in this discussion though. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Just curious, did you test significance against BM25 using the parameter settings in the MP 2.2 spec: k1=1.2, b=0.75, k3=500? I'm not clear on whether we're supposed to explore different BM25 parameters in addition to exploring parameters for other rankers. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I had the same issue for several submissions until I ran into #691. I defined my own c-value in my codes and it kept showing "InL2 not implemented correctly". When I replaced my own c-value with the self.param, it succeeded. Maybe you can try this. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think we are supposed to choose one ranker (I chose Jelinek-Mercer) from the listed ones in the assignment and change its parameters to get different average precisicion. And for the p-value, compare the results you get from your chosen ranker and the Inl2 ranker you wrote. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A small suggestion - Double check operator precedence for accurate results.    (X + 1) / Z  != X + 1 / Z REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: That's pretty close, but not meaningful, since the MAP will depend on the c/k2/self.param you've set. The way it looks in the AG, our InL2Ranker class is being instantiated with an unknown self.param and score_one() run against a number of unknown test sets. I would go back to my original suggestion of looking at the avg_p, or even the score_one score, of a known query-document pair.  I also second the other comment suggesting to check your operator precedence, as you might arrive at a similar MAP without correct score_one results.  
THREAD: MP2.2 Do i need to make changes in score_one function or create a separate function? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #641  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes. you will have to modify score_one function. Also  load_ranker function to specify the InL2Ranker. the comments within that method should provide details. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, you will need to implement it according to the formulas given. It is quite simple. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes , that is absolutely right  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, those are the output lines printed when you run the function, and those individual scores would be need to do the comparison and produce significance.txt later. 
THREAD: MP2.2 Search_eval.py As-is REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You are expected to implement class InL2Ranker(metapy.index.RankingFunction). search_eval.py  is not supposed to return something. Just print something.    I mean you can check the print results. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sorry, yes I meant is it supposed to print anything without modifications? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. You may add print at the begining of main(). If it is hard, you may hard code cfg file to a fixed file. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sry, could you elaborate more please? Below is what I see in powershell when i run the program now. Is there something I'm supposed to change in search_eval.py to make it work?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/afa79204-8d5d-42af-a355-7c907f669218/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: when you run the search file you need to run it as "python search_eval.py config.toml ". the script is expecting a parameter with it, which is the config file.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to add one more parameter. Otherwise, it cannot continue. You may print one line before this statement.  Or, you may change the code to get the config file by hardcode it REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes it would print one score per line/query and then MAP at the end.  what you are getting is kind of an error message, not an output. fix that and try rerunning. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to pass the config.toml file as a command line argument or, if using an IDE, by setting it as an execution parameter.  
THREAD: Is there going to be a study guide for the midterm? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think our practice quizzes and weekly quizzes are our reference points for midterm. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would like some extra practice for the material tho REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm not sure if there will be a study guide.

So I conjecture that the 11 points covered on the summary video/slide at the end of week 6 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/week/6) will each warrant about 2 questions per.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I have all the faculty links just fine, it's the bios from those links that I am having trouble retrieving  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It appears that there are more than one ```('div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8') ``` in the HTML. Does your previous code crawl the first one or the second one? Without a loop, it crawls the first one, and if there is no <p> in the first one, you will get a None.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In your code div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8' is not correct  it should be  ``` div', class_='col-xs-12 col-md-8'  pull left. ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: bios can be combined by different parts. you don't need to use one line to extract all info. for example, you can use h1 to get the title, and another line to get the main content REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Solved the problem in office hours!

THREAD: Lecture 4.3 Doc Model vs Doc word count REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Let's understand what is modeling? Modeling is a process to understand a phenomenon. Let me explain it using an example of Capacitor/Inductor/Resistor. when we have a piece of metal, it has properties e.g. getting heated when current is running, magnetism etc., but we model a piece of metal using imaginary models i.e. Pure Resistor/ Pure Capacitor/Pure Inductor/Ideal voltage/current source  to explain what happens in the real world.  Similarly, when we talk about the language model, we are taking some hypotheses to explain a phenomenon of a user entering words query in search irrespective of the presence of word in actual doc retrieved by query.  This is a link from britannica :- https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-modeling   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you for your answer. I do have one follow up question however:  If we take this particular Doc Model as a given hypothesis, how do we assign probability values to each of the words in it (even the ones not present in the doc)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In simple terms the word "update" is coming up in the query. Query does not exist in document. This is a valid scenario. Therefore, how do you assign probability to the word that we have not seen.  The above idea extends to further lectures where you will see something called "smoothing" to assign probabilities to unseen words. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, ok, got it. Thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the maximum likelihood estimator without smoothing, the words not present will get 0 probability but in further lecture, the professor talks about smoothing the techniques to overcome this problem. The practice quiz has a question for the problem in this estimator :-  <<<<< You are given the query Q= “food safety” and two documents:  D1 = “food quality regulations”  D2 = “food safety measures”  Assume you are using the maximum likelihood estimator without smoothing to calculate the probabilities of words in documents (i.e., the estimated p(w|D)p(w∣D) is the relative frequency of word ww in the document DD). Based on the unigram query likelihood model, which of the following choices is correct? <<<<<<   
THREAD: MP2.2 error when trying to index REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: config.toml should be in the directory where you are running python command (in command shell). for example if you are running it on c:/home/abc then it should be there.  if you are running a python script, then still it should be in the same directory as the script. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the file may be there but the rest of the files it refers to may not be, If I am understanding it correctly it is better to navigate to the folder we clone from github and launch python from there so everything will then be in relative path going forward.

THREAD: MP 2.2: t-test for significance testing? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: From [the link](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman1/auxillar/signtest.htm), you may find:   *The t-test is the standard test for testing that the difference between population means for two paired samples are equal. If the populations are non-normal, particularly for small samples, then the t-test may not be valid. The sign test is an alternative that can be applied when distributional assumptions are suspect. However, it is not as powerful as the t-test when the distributional assumptions are in fact valid. It can also be applied in the case where there is no quantitative scale, but it is possible to order the data (i.e., an ordinal scale). Dataplot states the sign test in terms of medians, but it can also be expressed in terms of means.*   For this assignment, we have 225 queries,  their 'average precision' follow a normal distribution. it is fine to use t test to compare two methods / rankers.   From code side, both are simple, as we are using some libs. Maybe based on Professor's long time observation, t test is better than sign test in this case. The idea here is for us to know how to compare two methods.  I will change this to un-resoved, so maybe TA or professor can give more ideas. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The large number (>30) of queries allows us to use t-test with normality assumption REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: apologies if this is pedantic but the t-test assumes the distribution of sample means is normal, not that the data itself is normally distributed, which is why the t-test tends to be robust  however the sample size at which the distribution of sample means approaches normality does depend on how non-normal the data is   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, you're right -- I should have remembered. My mistake looking up t-test assumptions on sites that skimmed the details. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hm, I get an InL2 average-precision distribution that has a spike near zero, with a long right tail. Wonder if I did it wrong. But Bill Guo pointed out that the normality assumption applies to the sampling distribution of means, not to the raw sample data. I'll go with it.

Then think again :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: lol no worries, I had this mixed up for ages too  yeah I've seen some sites get it wrong as well

THREAD: Statistical significance testing REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You may watch the following 3-min video to know Type 1 error. Or google "Statistical hypothesis testing, type I error".  We assume that a random variable follows a distribution,  so its values will fall in a 95% area (very possibly). It is unlikely to falls in a 5% area, so if it happens then we think our assumption is wrong.  Generally, we select apha = 0.5. For sure, you can set it to be 0.25. It depends on the practical usage.  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/error-probabilities-and-power/v/type-1-errors REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Conceptually this is related to the concept that if a value is within mean +/- 2 standard deviation then it is normal distribution where the values are random.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/76a2c18f-123c-4f29-b1ad-61dad93fb9bf/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For some additional related learning I would recommend researching Six Sigma, which is a standard of lean manufacturing.

THREAD: MP2.2 testing InL2 ranker implementation REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When you submit the code, the log file will show success or failure. And if your code is correct then you will see that score as 1 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I pushed to GitHub often to check progress and as specified in the readme - InL2Ranker will be worth 70% and the p-value will be worth 30%. If you check the logs in LiveData, and if your ranker doesn't work, it will say "InL2Ranker not working as expected" but that's as much as it will say. You will know it works if you see a 70% in coursera 😅😂 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: hmmm...there are few things expected here:  1. your code should return a value per item to be scored. you could check this by redirecting the output of the score function to a txt file (one score per query) - the question also indicates that. please note that I dont mean necessarily inside score one function, you can add it to the call to score in main too. you would need the txt files (from both Ln2 and BM25 functions - 2 text files) to compare them later and generate the significance file 2. the score per item should be according to the formula for the Ln2 algorithm. that you could verify looking at the theory 3. there should be a signficance.txt file (manually created as given in step 1 by comparing the two text files scores)  Now load ranker function could be modified (hardcoded) one by one to call BM25 first and then Ln2 (since you need two text files to calculate significance.txt) or by doing some sort of config based approach.  So, without submitting, if you get the two text files and are able to calculate the significance, your code is working. the score themselves are difficult to check - and you can take a sample or two for the Ln2 part to see if they were calculated correctly (you applied the right formula). that should tell you if it is working and working as expected.

Thanks!  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: 0.4 In unigram model , all probabilities should add up to 1, given that there are only 3 words, and two of them add up to 0.6, the third one's probability would be 1-0.6 =0.4. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Makes sense!! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think the professor wanted to test the knowledge of the unigram model :-) since clearly this is a trick question and can only apply to one missing word. if 2 or more words are missing, unigram model would not help. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Since we only have 3 words in this entire domain, p(text) + p(mining) + p(research) = 1. To generate the phrase "text mining research," we need all these words together, so we multiply the individual (independent) probabilities.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the unigram model, all the occurance probabilities of words sum up to 1, so (1-0.4-0.2)*0.4*0.2 = 0.032

THREAD: Unable to see my score in coursera REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Hi, check your github repository for MP2.2 and make sure the settings page looks like this:  ![settings.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/5eb1be50-49db-4001-b00e-a6eb7c96b6a5/settings.png)  If not, you may need to remake the repository.  Your webhook may not be set up correctly. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I remembered that I did this for all the repositories. I will double check later. Thanks, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If webhook is an issue, you would see an exclamation mark (warning sign instead of the green checkmark).  If webhook is not an issue, please reach out to Instructors in a private post asap and letting them know before it is too late. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This webhook should be good, as I got 1 already in livelab. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The webhook should be fine, as the score = 1 is visible in livelab. The connection between livelab and coursera is broken somehow.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I noticed that we need to click on the "Open Tool" button from Coursera's mp page at least once. Then, you can make some changes in your code and re-add/commit/push, then the score should be appeared in Coursera.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. It is true. How did you fix this issue? Thanks, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! It is done. 
THREAD: How the Score is calculated on Leaderboard REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Fourth score is the overall score, first one is the gdcp from AP news having weightage 0.1. Second is cranfield data set having weightage of 0.3 and third is the faculty dataset having weightage of 0.6.  I hope this clarifies REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If that is the case, then Rank is wrong - correct ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In my opinion, the rank is calculated from AP news. But you need to surpass baseline score to successfully complete MP2.4 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that's correct ... Does it not make sense to put Rank based on the "Overall Score" , not based on one of dataset which carries least weightage ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: We can check with one of the TAs REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: (0.1 X 0.4062228	+ (0.3 X 0.346420298)+ (0.6 X 0.907125938) = 0.688823932  and  (0.1 X 0.400295432) + (0.3 X 0.3527179) + (0.6 X 0.92627098) = 0.7016075  
THREAD: MP2.2 InL2 Implementation  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: yes that's all you have to do... implement the `score_one()`. The `ranking.score()` calls the `score_one()` internally and you don't have to change any logic flow in the main section per se or worry about calling with list of terms. The `ranking.score()`  function takes care of the summation for you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You don't have to write a new function to iterate each term. As Ujjal said,```score_one()``` will be called by ```ranker.score()```. This is because```InL2Ranker``` inherits from its parent class ```metapy.index.RankingFunction```. The ```score()``` method, which iterates all terms using ```score_one()``` has been defined in the parent class. In the MP, the new defined ```score_one()``` overrides the ```score_one()``` of the parent class, but the ```score()``` method of the parent class remains unchanged and can still be used.  
THREAD: Course Project Tools REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A related question: can we use a 'tool' that is freely available online, with complete credit given to that tool, but use it for a different application? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Are you talking about MPs? Or final project ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Final Project. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would contact the prof and/or TAs to be sure.  However I would be surprised if you weren't allowed because it seems that any project with a good framework / structure behind it can be proposed ("Free Topics"):  > Option 5: Free Topics You may freely propose a topic that is not listed in this document but relevant to this course. In your proposal, please answer the following questions: What are the names and NetIDs of all your team members? Who is the captain? The captain will have more administrative duties than team members. What is your free topic? Please give a detailed description. What is the task? Why is it important or interesting? What is your planned approach? What tools, systems or datasets are involved? What is the expected outcome? How are you going to evaluate your work? Which programming language do you plan to use? Please justify that the workload of your topic is at least 20*N hours, N being the total number of students in your team. You may list the main tasks to be completed, and the estimated time cost for each task. At the final stage of your project, you need to deliver the following: Your documented source code and main results. Self-evaluation. Have you completed what you have planned? Have you got the expected outcome? If not, discuss why. A demo that shows your code can actually run and generate the desired results. If there is a training process involved, you don’t need to show that process during the demo. If your code takes too long to run, try to optimize it, or write some intermediate results (e.g. inverted index, trained model parameters, etc.) to disk beforehand.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I would think yes. Tools are just supposed to be convenience, if you innovatively can use it for another purpose, all the more power to you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess the Professor's or TA's response to this question is preferable since they are the ultimate authority on such things. I.e., what any student taking this course now "thinks" is irrelevant. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your reply David. Where did you get the above quote from, I can't seem to find that anywhere on coursera (or linked to from there lol). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hrm, I can't seem to find it again either.  Here is the link:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ANy7FHYovh_2JL3gVrVvzXScDh5ol5l5XS2Nlp4DN4/edit 
THREAD: Is there a link where we can find previous years final project.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The Professor mentioned this in one of the earlier lessons. So, I'm guessing that these will be made available REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Professor Zhai provided the answer to this question here (first office hour - 8/25/2021) from minute 27:12 https://illinois.zoom.us/rec/play/NliSqy_6R_NRoRLoN2JP2T_wov7E7Xg0kHomlZMHDwzbtImlhn1pmeKopCywywMyfo-Yb5jcFKuI_dJZ.tp3jrEwgr8_yRSpX?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=xS0XxT7YQISQhnZklgZYCQ.1631560747507.2948474fc21c41d0b171a0e775d83103&_x_zm_rhtaid=674   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It will be available but I would suggest, don't depend on that completely, think of some text problem that you want to solve in the real world.

If that is still not your issue, reach out to instructors on a Private post and they would be able to help you.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you have submitted very well. You may send a msg to TAs & professor directly, so no penalty will apply, as you finished before the deadline.  Also check your livelab to double confirm you register accounts.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/assignments ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/523e4198-00a2-44f2-a869-db8d03c129ae/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1af0226c-e840-473a-94a5-c7624a689ad3/image.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: So far so good.   The only issue is whether you register your livelab well.   Contact TAs & professor directly. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Already did! Thanks a lot! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. I followed the exact steps in the instruction document and was able to receive grade for the first MP. I did exactly the same for MP2.1, and have not been able to receive grade so far. Already trying to make contact with instructors. Thanks a lot for helping out! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The account looks good. Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hello, Did you get the feedback? I met this issue also. After I submited twice, still no response, although I saw I got 1 in livelab. Thanks, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, I contacted TAs and they said we shouldn't worry as long as we had a score on livedatalab before the deadline. Here's also some ways you can try to solve similar problems: > 1.  Try linking your coursera account on LiveDataLab by typing "coursera.org" for Host Domain and using the university email address for Host Domain Username.  > 1. Try reopening the MP by clicking start on **Coursera assignment page** and type in username and password on the LiveDataLab page you are directed to. If you are directed straight to MP page without being asked to enter user name and password, try clearing the cache of LivedataLab website and redo the above steps.  > 1. If all of the above do not work, try clearing all cache of both liveDataLab and coursera, and log in again. If already linked the account, try delete the linked account and link again.  Remember to **push** to github repository if you tried any of the above steps. 
THREAD: Should we get rid of the header of webpage? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe we have to scrape the relevant bit from it- the bio/introduction for the faculty. Everything else can be trimmed down REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. In the sample that has been provided, it shows that we have to get the data from the main section of the HTML content so that it only takes the necessary info.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Scrape only the wanted details from profile. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I disagree - it’s not a strict requirement. In fact if you follow an example in the bio.txt you would see a para containing everything including the link texts. Now I am not saying that you can’t do it, but it should be up to you. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It's up to you where you want to start calling process_bio() from. I think it would make the most sense to skip the header and only pass in the soup containing the main body. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Only the necessary information is required 
THREAD: Is it ok to scrap professors' personal page(the page you got by clicking their name in Faculty page) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, the autograder does not care about which page is scraped. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The sample code already has a logic if the home page is not found it scraps the profile page. So what you are doing is correct.  Try looking for the comment in the sample code  ```  #treat faculty profile page as homepage ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that should be fine 
THREAD: MP2.2 c value REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: count  or  number of times  for e.g.  `c(t, D)` --> Number of times the term appears in the current doc `c(t, Q)` --> Number of times the term appears in the query REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: C function denotes the time term appeared in the document or query  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: This was confusing initially. c -> parameter C() -> implies a term weightage based on query/document etc 
THREAD: Is that okay to include 'chromedriver.exe' file in my submission? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that is OK. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: It is not necessary. If you commit it also, no harms. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Either way it's fine.  It is not required though.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes. Included in my assignment and no issues. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yea , you can include it. I also did without any issue REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Its usually not preferred (frowned upon) to upload an executables directly on Git.  you just need to put the absolute path of the chromedriver (can be anywhere on your system) in the driver object creation step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You could ‘touch .gitignore’ and then ‘git  rm —cached FILENAME’ to remove it from future commits 
THREAD: Is MP2.1 autograded? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. Correct.  Also make sure on Coursera Grade section you have received your grade too. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it is autograded. As long as you see "100%" against your assignment in the Grades page, you are good. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please make sure you see 100% in the grades in coursera page. Initially I got 1 on Livelab but when I looked at coursera I only got 30% (Because I did not check the google sheet before and used a link taken by another student.) That is a special case, but anyway checking the grades in coursra is the safest way : )  
THREAD: Index out of range issue with the scraper code REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Check if it is a blank list before applying the index [-1]? i.e. all_headers[0].get_text().lower().split() = [] REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Either this is empty `all_headers` Or this is empty: `all_headers[0].get_text().lower().split()`  Likely `all_headers` is empty  print function will be your good friend here to fix the issue, REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This usually comes when you try to execute the notebook from between or miss any section. try to execute all the parts again.   this happened with me too as the webdriver object was getting lost and had to run it from beginning REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: was trying to execute the entire code at once but was still getting the error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: it didn't work REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: put a condition before if it is empty or not but still didn't work REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm not sure if you are still facing the error. try placing the variables that extract the information in a try-except block and then try executing the code. So when the index goes out of range it will skip the value and move on to the next.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hey Sagar, If you are still stuck !! Let me know if you want to get on a call and mitigate this ? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you Kushagra. Appreciate your willingness to help. This particular issue was resolved but was stuck at a different place. I am kind of pretty new to python. Would definitely appreciate some guidance on how I can improve and get up to speed and also would love to have open discussions on the course content. 
THREAD: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text' REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: ``` 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text'``` Your code is trying to call `get_text` from `profile_sec`. But `profile_sec` is empty (None). Check how you are you getting data on `profile_sec` and probably fix that (it should not be None). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm adding data to profile_sec like this profile_sec = soup.find('div',class_='field-engr-link')     if profile_sec is not None:         all_websites = profile_sec.find_all('a')  since there is only one a tag under that div class  ![siteInspection.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/39501ff4-265e-42bd-9c09-3f6131555f72/siteInspection.PNG)  but I'm not sure why it's showing as None? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: hmm.. looks strange as it should get the element. For testing purposes, try putting any other element to see if it is returning values for that other element and/or class. And then go from there understanding why not for that specific div.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I attempted with other elements but receive the same error. Could the problem be how I'm trying to retain the elements?    I used code similar to the sample given: ![Capture.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6fc1bb8a-b5aa-4a95-ad45-a116aeec5f9c/Capture.PNG)  but it doesn't seem to be copying the hrefs. Any ideas?  Ps thanks so much for trying to help with this, it's much appreciated REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try printing `all_websites` after the `profile_sec` line  to see if it has any values.  Also the line just below the try appears to do nothing . That line may need a revisit too.  At any point you can print your variables to see the content, if that helps.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I tried printing but receive the same error and no printed output D:  So stuck on this, thank you for trying to help REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Look for your first `profile_sec` variable and try to print that. which should be before the first `if` statement in the above code. Most probably the issue with your first `profile_sec`  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok this is weird, I tried printing the 1st profile_sec and it prints out 'None'! But I've typed in the correct location where the personal pages are found   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/205b32ea-d3ac-4ed3-8079-69572f1f4ff2/image.png)  so I'm not sure why my code  profile_sec = soup.find('div',class_='field-engr-link') if profile_sec is not None: all_websites = profile_sec.find_all('a')  isn't working.

THREAD: bios.txt formatting REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Correct...  and each line number in `bio_urls.txt` should refer to the data with same corresponding line number in `bios.txt`. In short, you have to maintain same order in both files.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Okay, thank you! REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that's the expectation. The sequence of faculty url in bios_url.txt and biography in bios.txt should match. Sometimes if the biography is too big, the editor would wrap up the information into multiple lines. That should not be a problem. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes , that is the correct  understanding 
THREAD: is it okay to treat the faculty profile page as home page? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: See here https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/185  Question 1: What is expected? Question 2: What are supposed to do? Question 3: How to use jupyter notebook? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: One home page has multiple professor urls. Based on these urls, you need to find detailed bio REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yu do need more than 5-6 faculty urls to be graded properly. I suggest, google for a university "computer science university faculty" and try to find a suitable university. (It might take a half n hr, but you will find one, which is not used yet). Do an inspect on the faculty page to see if the page has  href tags and urls. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The expectation is to first find a university and dept that has not been scrubbed already. Once you find it, then scrub and find out all the professors in that dept. Publish this in the bio_urls file. Then scrub these individual faculty's bio from their individual pages and publish in bios file and the sequence should match the one in urls file. Also you do not need jupyter notebook for this and can just do by with python... 
THREAD: handshake failed error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: If that is your expected faculty count with the right urls you should be fine.  You might be curious about those error (and want to resolve for clean execution) but auto grader shouldn't care for these error lines as long as you have right content on the `bios.txt` and `bio_urls.txt`. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I believe you can. the autograder is only looking for the text files and the .py file in your submission.  
THREAD: What to do if most professors do not have a bio present? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Use a different university or dept. or You can ignore them if they do not have a bio. However, at least 6 is good enough. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Does the bio_url link take to the page where professor's some info is there?  As long as you have information for the professor from the original bio_url link you should be good. The corresponding professor page may or may not have a link to their home page.   e.g. for UIUC English department there is only information about the professor but no home page [](https://english.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jbarnard) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I chose to ignore those without a bio, and it worked fine. I believe you'll need at least 6 examples, based on other posts I've read. If you can't get that many examples, I'd choose a different webpage. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: None of the professors on my page had a second level homepage link, but all had an institution hosted bio webpage. I just scraped those pages and got good information and full credit on the MP. 
THREAD: Selenium on an as-needed basis 
THREAD: bios.txt and bio_urls.txt empty for sample code REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will have to modify your code based on the corresponding university / faculty page. The sample code is for html of UIUC page, though there have been changes in UIUC html too. Therefore, it won't work without necessary modification based on current html.  Please refer to beautiful soup [reference](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and a good explanation from Tengjun [here](https://github.com/ttt-77/MP2.1-sample-code ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I am not modifying the code at all. Please read the question. I am deliberately trying to run the UIUC faculty page. I am deliberately running the exact same sample code.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: UIUC faculty html page also had changes. Sample code is not as per current html of UIUC. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes the sample code is not up to date  to match the latest version of the faculty page. Or in other words the sample code is not being maintained for any changes in the UIUC Website. Last year, UIUC website went through some major UI changes  which i guess broke the full functionality of the sample code. 
THREAD: MP2.1 Using the sample code REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: correct. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 3]: Yes we are allowed to do that. The only think you are not allowed to do is use any UIUC faculty pages. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, that is correct. You can make appropriate modifications to suit the department you have picked. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, and make sure you do not use any existing faculty page as well. Addition to that, i found adding an else condition in the step where you search for text on the scraped html page. This will help you debug whether you are getting any data or not. ```  if bio.strip()!= '' and bio_url.strip()!='':         bio_urls.append(bio_url.strip())         bios.append(bio) else:        print ('No Data found !!!') ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Also consider using something like Visual Studio Code to step through your script and inspect the variables. Here's a doc to walk you through how to use VS Code for Python debugging.  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: As long as you produce the required output files and have the required structure, it is allowed. It has been helpful to keep printing the extracted elements (from `find` or `find_all`) /urls and tailor the loops according to your webpage - which you can write yourself with the help of the view page source option.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, and if I may add most of the code for scraping is redundant- your structure might be very simple - I personally deleted all of it and just coded 3-4 lines to scrape my code. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I believe that it's correct 
THREAD: how to scrape under span REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Not sure what extent of code can be shared publicly. I believe if you have question with your code sections , it should be asked to instructors in a private post. You can always ask generic question here to everyone with minimum or no code sharing. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Refer https://github.com/ttt-77/MP2.1-sample-code by Tengjun to understand this code better . REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: A simple link to stack overflow is allowed :)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes I have read that and that’s where I’m inspiring my code from. My query is how to get the a href under span instead of div tag REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You are getting error while fetching 'href' from anchor (a). This happens if there is no anchor element in 'link_holder'. I guess the span element you are looking in the html page with class 'field-content' has the anchor but there might other span elements without the anchor element.  I recommend printing the element when you face this kind of issues to identify which span element matches the class but not having anchor.  ``` print(link_holder) ```  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You could consider retrieving the faculty list first by doing a  ``` facultyList = soup.find_all('div', attrs={'class': 'views-row', 'class': 'academic'}) ``` Then you can extract the faculty name and URL.  ``` for faculty in facultyList:     facultyItemSoup = faculty.find('span', attrs={'class': 'field-content'}) ``` Where the faculty name can be extracted using facultyItemSoup.text and the URL by doing a subsequent .find on facultyItemSoup for the 'a' element and extracting the href as you have already done. I tried this on my machine and was able to extract all 37 of the faculty list items with name and URLs.  I found it useful myself to construct a dictionary of faculty with fields of name, URL, and bio. Also don't forget to cleanup the extracted text from the faculty pages to ensure there's no erroneous new lines. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I figured it out but thanks Ben! I was able to get all 37 faculty members too :)  
THREAD: Scraping faculty url error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is your Google Chrome browser version and the chromedriver that you have downloaded is same REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Not sure what extent of code can be shared publicly. I believe if you have question with your code sections , it should be asked to instructors in a private post. You can always ask generic question here to everyone with minimum or no code sharing. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I believe they are the same version because I was able to run all the other chrome driver codes  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This error may be due to the Chrome driver not available for Jupyter notebook. Once you download the webdriver, you can move it to appropriate folder and provide full path instead of relative path. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I already did that and I even tried removing the ./ from but I had no luck. I'm honestly not sure how to fix this error ``` driver = webdriver.Chrome('./chromedriver',options=options) ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please check the URL also whether it is accessible.   ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED is a DNS error when it can't resolve an IP for a website  ![](blob:https://campuswire.com/80ab83fd-ebce-4193-93dc-2efd77d478db) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Check [ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/err-name-not-resolved-error/#:~:text=When%20you%20receive%20the%20%E2%80%9CERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED,connection%20with%20the%20web%20server.) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: './chromedriver' isnt neccessarily the correct path its only a part of a path.  Try finding the driver on your computer and then press shift while you right click, there should be an option to 'copy as path' that should give you the path. Note: this is for windows if you have another system search online how to find the path of a file it should be similar. 
THREAD: bio_url.txt and bios.txt files are empty REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You will have to change your code based on the html of the faculty page/university page that you are accessing. You have probably not made required changes.   Please refer to [beautiful soup reference](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and a good explanation from Tengjun [here](https://github.com/ttt-77/MP2.1-sample-code ) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: did this happen to you when you were doing the sample? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: if so then this might help: https://github.com/ttt-77/MP2.1-sample-code REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I made changes to the sample code according to the faculty page I selected but just not sure what got scrapped as the text files are empty. ![Screen%20Shot%202021-09-12%20at%202.45.01%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/012ee358-7a50-4e2f-9c97-69087200d071/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-12%20at%202.45.01%20PM.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: try printing out each list that gets created, helped me debug the issue.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For me the first part (where we get the urls) of the code worked when I just replaced the appropriate links, for the most part, except that I did not need to add the base url to the url I got.  But for the second part where we get the bios I had to write the code myself because the university's page was different than uiuc's 
THREAD: Where should I save the chromium web driver REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Keep in the folder where your .py file is REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Would it make any difference if it were a jupyter notebook? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: #579  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The chromedriver can be anywhere in you system. Just you need to specify the absolute path in the driver object creation step.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, I copied it to windows's system32 folder, and it worked.  
THREAD: git push error REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: After you have complete the assignment, you need to be inside the parent folder of your repository (the parent folder should have the `.git` file) and then push using  ``` git push origin main ```  like you did in MP1. Same process. No change. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: It seems you are trying to push the initial MP2.1 to your MP2.1_private. You should do this step before cloning the MP2.1_private repo for assignment purpose.  Go to the directory where you clone --bare , the MP2.1 repo.  Check if the below command return any details. ``` git status ``` if this does not return anything, i would suggest, follow the below process from the beginning.  https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/Dzke2aP9TGC5Htmj_Sxgjg_59737a6e41dc41efae3c1c5ca47d5da2_mp-setup.pdf?Expires=1631577600&Signature=K5Na2DFtuuQoNIrnqgKkxXPomDJilUo9j~bsWvq0v3OeQXi3v~Ac-HCdgSFzACLTDhdbtheW2witmlWyXK~7EhXqenMe3imFdbfyb4FhZKdf6W4j76Cumz32vZzNDW0bOSEq1b94SV-Fb7XSuccZaBKmb7Bl5wGnlZfMHyGkF-Q_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A 
THREAD: MP 2.2 importing scipy REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: what the grader is complaining? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The bottom 6 lines of the post are errors from the grader REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: scipy code section is for your use only.. You just have to add the p-value in the `significance.txt`  and add that file in repo.. Not the code you used to check the p-value.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I just wrote a separate short script to calculate the p-value from the avg_p files and write it to significance.txt. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yeah, I did separate script too. The significant.txt file only requires the comparison result, so no need import the scipy inside the search_eval.py.  
THREAD: Do we need to create ad different repository for each part of MP2? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes.  For every MP assignment a new repository needs to be created. MP2.1, MP2.2, MP2.3 and MP2.4 are considered as separate assignments so each should have their own respository.  Here is the course instruction that need to be done for every MP assignment:  https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/Dzke2aP9TGC5Htmj_Sxgjg_59737a6e41dc41efae3c1c5ca47d5da2_mp-setup.pdf?Expires=1631577600&Signature=K5Na2DFtuuQoNIrnqgKkxXPomDJilUo9j~bsWvq0v3OeQXi3v~Ac-HCdgSFzACLTDhdbtheW2witmlWyXK~7EhXqenMe3imFdbfyb4FhZKdf6W4j76Cumz32vZzNDW0bOSEq1b94SV-Fb7XSuccZaBKmb7Bl5wGnlZfMHyGkF-Q_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes. Each part of the MP2 will be named like this. Make sure to keep the private as lowercaps. (This info is not given in MP2.1 readme, but it worked for me)   MP2.1_private MP2.2_private and so on... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In week 1 Programing Assignment Overview section they mentioned in bold that MP Setup need to be completed for each MP. I think that's why they didn't reiterate in every MPs.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/78f7c6ac-015d-457b-8bab-ce368c9ead2e/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Correct.. But Its present in future MPs though.. I mistakenly cloned MP2.4 which had this detail. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ahh... Gotcha. :)  
THREAD: live data lab REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Can you go to the leaderboard tab and check once? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Please check after sometime, processing normally takes a little while. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I just checked its all good now, like you said it just takes some time REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Projects -> MP2.1 -> Click on Submission  See “Submission Details” alternatively, you can look at the last two lines of the “Submission Log” 
THREAD: In this scenario, we care more about recall, right? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Very good explanation in #531 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: How I understood this question is that we want to have high recall because any time someone is tweeting about a terrorist plot it is important to know.  So in this context -> F-Measure (beta often set to 1). Beta controlls the emphasis on percison/recall. A smaller beta value, such as 0.5, gives more weight to precision and less to recall whereas a larger beta value, such as 2.0, gives less weight to precision and more weight to recall.  Therefore since we want high recall we want a higher beta value. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I explained it in 531 as link given in an answer below, but the simple explanation is that precision*recall/precision+recall - which is a simplification of formula - when precision goes higher the sum (in denominator) goes towards it - thus the division would cancel out precision/precision leaving recall - on the other hand if recall goes higher the sum would be closer to it, thus cancelling recall/recall in the formula.  
THREAD: Do not know how to fix the result REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Found a lot of empty lines, so these 2 files are not consistent.  You may manually remove the empty lines, and submit again to give a try. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The expected one looks like that one. Both should have the same line numbers.  Check your code to ensure you delete the last "\n" per url. You can delete the empty lines directly also  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/fca51dec-0c05-4b24-8aaf-f3ea797f577e/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your sharings, anyway. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for your sharings. ;> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: how did you fix it? Thanks REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, just found the empty lines and removed these lines both in url.text and bio.text. Hope it helps. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Consider using .replace on the string and replacing \n with "" (empty) or " " (space). This ensures there's no erroneous new lines prior to writing the correctly formatted text to your file. 
THREAD: Scrap links problem REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think you do not need to bother about this , the website seems to have implemented pagination at the view label only i.e if I am on first page and do a *view page source* in the browser, i can able to see all the data of your faculty   Your faculty information is present on this table element ( below is just an example of 1 of the faculty )   <td>Faculty</td> <td><a href="**/study/colleges_schools/hrsm/faculty-staff/augur-tenney-zanne.php**">Augur, Zanne Tenney, MIBS</a></td> REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hello, Abhijit,  It looks like I can only find these 25 people there:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/f36b91ce-3c59-4610-a788-e45e3764556d/image.png)  If I want to find others, I need to go to the next page. And <tbody> will refresh, during which the URL of the website does not have any change. So, I do not know how to scrape others listed on pages 2~5. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you can find at least 6, it is fine, so the first page is enough.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, I know. But still interested at this question. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: You can use the same approach as How you navigate from Main faculty directory page to Individual faculty page by checking the anchor's href of the 'next' button/text until you reach the last page in recursive approach.  In the Sample code,  Scrape directory page --> Find the href of the individual faculty --> Scrape individual faculty   In you case, 1. Scrape directory page 2. Scrape the first page  3. Find the href of the individual faculty and add to the list 4. Find the href of 'next' button/text 5. Scrape the href obtained from the next page  6. Go to Step 3 until the last page  7. ... REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: There should be a url pattern for pagination that you should able to loop over REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hi, Munesh,  Thanks for the details.

I also tried to replace 'https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/hrsm/faculty-staff/' with '***view-source***:https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/hrsm/faculty-staff/.' Unfortunately, It does not work. Is there a way to use 'view-source:....' page directly?  Thank you, Munesh. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Browsing your faculty page, it doesn't look like anyone has a second level homepage link. I had a similar situation and just scraped the first link level institution faculty pages. That worked well and satisfied the assignment requirements. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Hey, May. Thanks for your sharing. Yes, I know it can pass the test. However, I am trying to make my code more meaningful. I will keep updating if I got any solution.  Zizi

Once you clone the repository as "MP2.1_private", you need to create a new directory "scraper_code" (which will have your selected university faculty page scraping code). That scraper_code will contain the .ipynb (python notebook) OR .py (python execution file) - You can select any of the two ways of writing your code.  When you execute the code , the "bio_urls.txt" and  "bio.txt" text files will be created inside this "scraper_code" directory (The text files position doesn't matter, it worked for me).  Just re-using the Sample code and making tag related modifications (after inspecting the target HTML) will create these text files in the required format. 
THREAD: Unable to write data into text file  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Sample code need some modification.

This will help in debugging whehter you are getting any text OR not. The possible reason for No text in the Bio files is that the tag you are looking is not present or you are finding the incorrect HTML tag for the object you are looking for.  ``` if bio.strip()!= '' and bio_url.strip()!='':         bio_urls.append(bio_url.strip())         bios.append(bio) else:        print ('No Data found !!!') ```

THREAD: “No module named 'selenium'" error 
THREAD: Practice Quiz 3 Question 6 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: I selected "Lower" at first but think the answer provided is correct. This is a kind of situation you want to make sure you go through as much information as possible which means higher percentage of R in F calculation.   For example, there are 10 tweets that contain some hints of the attacking plan and usually they are pieces of information. Government agent needs to connect them to figure out the real plan that can stop the plan. You want to review all of them to make sure you can make right decision. When you find out 5 of them, you may have higher precision rate but you may not be able to make correct decision based on them.    You can see from denominator in the below equation. If beta is large, the percentage of the recall R will be higher  in F as well. [](url)![Screen%20Shot%202021-09-09%20at%2011.41.22%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/4082b617-0dbf-4150-8402-10a11a190b3f/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-09%20at%2011.41.22%20AM.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 4]: I can try: this is the formula:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/1a6eff7c-3f53-49cb-bece-ed054f021411/image.png)  Now, as we increase the value of beta - the denominator increases closer to precision, and negating the effect of recall (in the overall sum). But remember, this is a division, so the closer you move to precision, the more the ratio (precision)(recall)/(precision+recall) moves towards (precision)(recall)/(precision) thus cancelling the precision part, and giving more importance to recall.  On the other hand, when beta is small the ratio moves towards (precision)(recall)/( recall) thus cancelling recall and giving more importance to precision.  You can verify it mathematically using different values of beta. Sorry my theoretical maths isnt great, I just used some logic to arrive at that. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: What we need is Recall to be higher compare to precision. when BETA = 0 in F-Measure F0 = Precision when BETA = 1 in F-Measure F1 = (P*R)/(P+R) and so on.  as you see above, as BETA increases Recall is rewarded. Therefore answer is higher since we want a system with high Recall

THREAD: Grid for Precision and Recall REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Basically, before you evaluate the system, you clearly knows which are related and which are not related. Here,  **Relevance Judgments** is a good reference data, which is generated by some experts somehow. It is like a job interview, you an interviewer knows the answers (Relevance Judgments) already, so you can judge.  **Given one query**  like the following picture, we know that in the data collection we totally have 10 related documents, and system A only give you 3 results (D2, D1, D4), based on **Relevance Judgments**, you know they are related (D2+, DD1+ sign), or they are not related ( D4-), so following the table you provided, you can calculate.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/b013eac1-c9e4-4182-81fd-e35272497f95/image.png) REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: > In the below grid 'b' falls under [Not Retrieved, Relevant]. What does that mean?  Ways to think about **Precision**: - are retrieved results relevant? - what % of all docs we returned/retrieved were relevant/correct/true?  Ways to think about **Recall**: - have all the relevant docs been retrieved? - what % of all the relevant/correct/true docs did we return/retrieve?  In this case, it essentially means that our algorithm said a document was NOT relevant, even though it was.  > How do we know the relevancy if the document is yet to be retrieved?  To calculate Precision and Recall we need to have a master list of correct answers, for example: doc1: relevant, doc2: not relevant, ... lastdoc: ___ So, whether we retrieve it or not, we have the answer as to whether it is relevant  > In Recall calculations it looks like the 'a+b' is just the total collection of documents irrespective of relevancy.  total collection of documents = a + b + c + d  All this is confusing because it's set up in the context of Precision@ and Recall@.  It may be easier to think of it first as the algorithm returning all documents and setting them to True/False.  Then think about how Precision and Recall would work if we calculate each of them for each cumulative list:  [ Precision/Recall for [doc1], Precision/Recall for [doc1,doc2],...Precision/Recall for [doc1:docN]] REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: We are calculating recall upto a cutoff point, say 10. Said differently if we retrieve all documents then recall will always be 1. Hence a+b is documents retrieved till the point we stop, and the ones that we haven't retrieved. Hope that helps REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the detailed answer, makes sense now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: b is pre-determined to be relevant document count, in testing the system under controlled conditions. that is how we are testing the precision and recall (again in lab conditions).   In real world situations, yes you are right, you can't just tell based on a search that the recall factor is x since you dont know which unretrieved documents are relevant.

Perhaps just scrape each page and save the text into each line of the bios.txt? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The DevTools in Chrome will help you to understand the HTML structure. Please press F12 and find the Elements menu. That will be the first step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Correct.

Also when they say scrape the page and save the "content",what is the content here? Does it include faculty image,contact number,education,research publications etc or just short intro at the beginning. Eg: http://www.msrit.edu/department/faculty-detail.html?dept=cse&ID=0  should I scrape the started short intro about the faculty and save in a text file?  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ok, I also suffered a similar issue. The faculty page in my first target school had only a short introduction under the same page, no link to the faculty page as an external web page.  I also considered scrapping those sub-pages and submit as it is, but eventually decided to find another university because the suggested sample code seems to expect us to scrap independent faculty web pages (outside of faculty pages in university).  Scrapping sub-pages is also scrapping obviously, but I guess it is safer to follow the structure and intention of sample files. Just my opinion. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The university that I have chosen does have individual faculty webpages.Unable to scrape that content to put in a txt file REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Similar confuse.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "Also when they say scrape the page and save the "content",what is the content here? Does it include faculty image,contact number,education,research publications etc or just short intro at the beginning."  Going by the sample given, it includes everything on the page (the visible text) - even if it is the text for links and menus. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to ensure that you have at least 6 links in the bios_url.txt. Also, all the links in bios_url.txt are called in bios.txt or at least you have information for each of the link.   In order to help you read html and write the code, it will be helpful to "right click" on the page that you navigate to for bios.txt and "Inspect" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Bios can be scraped from either the homepage itself or a separate faculty webpage as far as I understand. One tip would be to select a university with a homogenous landing page for all faculty pages.

See [this stack overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16206380/python-beautifulsoup-how-to-remove-all-tags-from-an-element).  You must also remove any carriage returns from the bios. So I just found the 'main' content-y part of the page, and pulled all text from that into a single line. It's difficult to read, but the core point isn't for it to be human readable... it's for a search engine, in theory.

THREAD: Recall in Lecture Slides REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Recall denominator is based on -- "how many total relevant docs are present among the document collection" which is 10 in above sample. That's why for both example A and B, it is 10 in denominator for calculating Recall.  5 is total documents retrieved in example B and 3 are relevant so precision is 3/5. Whereas in example A, 2 docs are relevant among 3 retrieved docs so precision is 2/3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think your confusion arises from the fact that both A and B combined found only 5 relevant documents from the document collection. They both fell short in a way there, if you can call it that - there were 10 total relevant documents. that is why their recall is lower while precision is higher.  also to be noted that since A and B both give their result as total of 8 (3+5), even at 100% precision their recall would still not be 100% total. That is why the more documents the system returns, the more chances are that the recall would go higher. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "even at 100% precision their recall would still not be 100% " 100% precision is when c=0. 100% recall is when b=0 What does one (c=0) have to do with the other (b=0)? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: c and b are fetched or at least derived from the same pool of documents, plus they are bound by the system's efficiency - my point was simply that there is a minimum number of retrievals needed even for the most perfect system (100% precision). In the example, even that minimum is not met. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, but both b and c can simultaneously be zero, which contradicts the claim that, "would still not be 100%" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: no they can't be, for the given scenario of 8 total retrievals (3+5)  - I commented on that specific case. in general yes both can be 0. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In case of recall, I guess it does not matter how many documents are retrieved by the system. To calculate recall we need to consider how many relevant documents are there in the pool of documents.   On the other hand, the Precision does depend on how many documents are retrieved by the System.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You need to check total documents retrieved in example B, which is 5. There are 3 relevant ones thus the answer for B is 3/5.  In example A, the docs retrieved is 3. 2 docs are relevant so precision is 2/3   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the example give,  System A:  a=2, b=8, c=1  So, precision = 2/(2+1)=2/3        recall = 2/(2+8) = 2/10  System B: a=3, b=7, c=2 So, precision = 3/(3+2) = 3/5       recall = 3/(3+7) = 3/10

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, it looks like the submission checks only 2 results files and does not actually run the submitted script.  That's weird but also makes sense. Because scrapping documents from the Internet does not always guarantee a consistent result. There are many factors that affect scrapping including internet reliability, security configuration, and even government policy. Even you can find the order of scrapping is not always the same whenever running your code.

THREAD: Practice quiz 3 -Question 5 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: "at k document" means using system A and system B to retrieve top k documents for the same query. If system A has higher precision then system A retrieved more relevant documents than system B, therefore the recall is also higher.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The trick here is to assume there's a fixed number of relevant documents -- say, 10.  Recall = (# relevant documents retrieved) / (# all relevant documents) Precision = (# relevant documents retrieved) / (# all retrieved documents)  For A to have higher recall than B for any k, A must always retrieve more relevant documents than B for each k. This also means that A always has a higher proportion of relevant documents in what it retrieved.  If system A and B both retrieve 3 documents, and A pulled 3 relevant documents while B only pulled 2:  A's recall = 3/10 B's recall = 2/10  This automatically means that a higher proportion of A's retrieved documents are relevant:  A's precision = 3/3 B's precision = 2/3 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: " Does this also apply to when system A has higher recall at any k document than system B then system A has higher precision at any position ?"  I would think yes. if A recalls more documents than B at given k, it means it retrieved more relevant document, given k retrievals, thus, its precision would be higher than B too.

Now, if you look down the list, well, it won't happen until, we have, seeing another relevant document. In this case D5, at that point, the, the recall is increased through three out of ten, and, the precision is three out of five. <<<<<  Therefore recall changes only when the next relevant doc is in the ranked list. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Here's a counterexample to the claim below: "if A recalls more documents than B at given k, it means it retrieved more relevant document, given k retrievals, thus, its precision would be higher than B too." Assume there are 20 documents, 10 of which are relevant.           A                                                                 B           4       6                                              3           7           9       1                                              5           5           ------------                                         ---------------------          13     7                                               8          12 recall:   4/10                       >                 recall: 3/10 precision: 4/13=0.31        <             precision: 3/8=0.38    REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: A post below states, "If system A has higher precision then system A retrieved more relevant documents than system B, therefore the recall is  also higher." Here's a counterexample. How about A: a=3, c=3   and B: a=4, c=6 So precision A: 3/6         and B: 4/10 Here, precision(A) > precision(B) but A retrieved 3 relevant documents and B retrieved 4 relevant documents (i.e., A retrieved FEWER relevant documents than B) Since the number of relevant (a+b) documents is fixed, A's recall would be LOWER than B's in this example.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: the question also states at a given K so if the system is at the 5th doc (k=5 i.e. retrieved only 5 relevant docs out of 10 relevant docs) the recall for A is 0.4 and B is 0.3 and the precision for A is 4/5 while B is 3/5 so A is still having a higher precision. Any thoughts on this?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: No.   The following policies will be enforced while taking your exam:  The exam will be closed notes (i.e., no external material allowed). You may use two sheets of scratch paper during the exam. No calculators are allowed.  No bathroom breaks are allowed. If you are disconnected during the exam for less than 5 minutes, log back in to ProctorU as soon as you're able to resume the exam. If you are disconnected for more than 5 minutes, you must reschedule the exam with ProctorU. Make sure your internet connection is stable before you begin the exam. Also be sure to submit your exam before disconnecting from ProctorU.   REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: When you say no external material is allowed, does that mean we can use Coursera notes?

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use BM25 to generate bm25.avg_p.txt and compare that to the your custom function InL2 results.

THREAD: MP2.2 Math Module Issue on LiveLab 
THREAD: Query/user variety for evaluating TR systems REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: That's a great question! It mostly depends on the TR system that is being developed and the targeted users. For example, Google would want to evaluate for both types of queries and make their TR engine very general to favor recall, whereas Amazon would mostly get very specific queries and would want a very precise system.  However, evaluating different types of query intents is another problem altogether. In the Cranfield methodology, the people who design the queries, also assign relevance scores to the documents. As you correctly pointed out, this set of people could have different notions of "relevancy". Eg Google Scholar, for a query like `Information Retrieval`, some users could consider the oldest paper as more relevant, while some would want a recent survey paper. So if we use a single relevance scale, different users might want to give different relevance scores to a document.  There could be multiple ways of dealing with this problem. For each query-document pair, the relevance score can be assigned based on some aggregation (avg/median score by all users). Or you could design your query set in a way that covers all kinds of user intents. Another way would be to simulate different types of query responses by tweaking your system/model parameters and testing against the same query set. These are all very resource-intensive methods, and commercial IR systems tend to rely more on auxiliary features like filters/facets/sort-by-X to handle different user intents. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! This is helpful. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: In addition to Dattatreya's answer, I'd also think there's potential for creating search profiles for different users to determine which kind of TR system is preferred by that user at a particular time. For example, you can run A/B or multi-armed bandit tests on a few different TR systems that are optimized for different types of users. Analyzing the click-through rates for suggestions will help inform the system on which TR system is best suited for that type of user. I think it's also important to consider that a user's search habits aren't constant either; for example, a student's search preferences will vary drastically depending on whether they're in school or on break. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: MABs are quite useful for user personalization on ranked lists. An alternative to different TR systems is having different weight matrices for different user profiles and learning a MAB on them. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for this question and the answers. I was wondering about the same and it makes sense now 
THREAD: Lesson 3.5: lowest relevance level 1 instead of 0? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: There's no such convention. 1-N is preferred for ease of interpretation. Source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32389/is-0-a-valid-value-in-a-likert-scale REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Ah, whoops. Right, there is no fixed convention on Likert scales.  It just seemed weird to me that lesson 3.5 assigned irrelevant documents a weight of 1, so they have 1/3 the weight of relevant documents instead of none of the weight. It's better if I just remember relevant documents will always carry more weight, regardless of whether irrelevance is 0 or 1.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: I think it was a little confusing for me too, since in the video/example, the number of relevant document was same as the number in the list (10) - probably would have been a little better if relevant document count would have been different (<>10) than the list size REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, exactly. That is why I made the mistake in the first place.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: " recall is implicitly accounted for in the denominator."

Community edition does provide virtual env, git, docker, kubernetes etc.    PyCharm Community vs Professional edition differences are outlined here:  https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce  PyCharm Community Edition download link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac  Good Luck.

THREAD: Language in the faculty home page REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In the instructions, they say they only want ascii characters submitted, so I suppose so long as you can scrape the bio pages while accommodating that limitation, why not? Though to be honest, you're probably making your life more difficult by doing that haha.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You're right. I am walking a harder way, but I have some fun because that gives me some idea of language detection.  Since Asian characters have different code numbers in Unicode, it is not so difficult to extract them. But it will be more complicated to decide the dominant language in a document, which is another topic of document relevance.'  Anyhow, it is more difficult but worth drilling down, especially for international students like me.

THREAD: MP1 submission - LiveDataLab Status: Failure 
THREAD: MP1 Setup REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Yes, you will have to install python first and then update the pip. pip is a package management system used to install and manage packages in python.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Is there a guide on Coursera for how to install Python, or do I just google and install Python by myself? Thanks. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: im unsure about it, probably you will have to do it by yourself.  I used: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/ website to download it.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can also download and install Anaconda. This comes with latest version of Python. The beauty of Anaconda is you can create a virtual environment with customized version of Python (for MP1, you need Python version 2.7 or 3.5. For me, Python version 3.5 worked). Once you have this setup complete, then just follow the instructions. Hope this helps.. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yes, if you follow this thread [325](https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/325) to install anaconda, use virtual env to use python 3.5, then follow the MP instructions, you should be good to go!

I am not sure if the approach is correct but I used rmdir /S. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: This is the correct approach. "rm" is a Linux command while "rmdir" is the windows equivalent. Later in the MP1 you will see the command "wget", which is also a Linux command but can be downloaded for windows. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think this worked, thanks!

If using mac, then you can use brew to install REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use  ```  brew install wget ``` to install wget in Mac. Alternatively, you can replace the get command with ``` !curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt --output lemur-stopwords.txt ``` and the later command with  ``` !curl -OL https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/releases/download/v3.0.1/greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz --output greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz ``` REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Checkout my answer to #18, I have provided the link to setup wget.

Livedatalab does not provide sufficient logs to perform testing there.  Ideally, you should see score of 1 that will translate into 100%.

With pyenv, I’m able to switch between versions. It was challenging for me personally and that’s after having some intermediate Python experience.  Here’s a link to the steps for pyenv and Mac dependencies. Paying special attention to the zshrc / “Configure your shell’s enivironmenr” section:  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout  Then following these steps to install Python using pyenv:  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1740#issuecomment-738749988 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: In case it’s of use, my shell configuration for Mac Big Sur is in the replies at #16. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I struggled heavily with the same on MacOS Big Sur. I am new to Python and spent so much time trying to figure this out.  I found that same post, and fortunately the steps worked for me without issue to get me going on Python 3.5.x.  I was running into similar errors when I was trying to install first `META` (per the text) and then `metapy`, but with a later Python version (3.8.x).  One thing that was getting me farther down that (ultimately unsuccessful) route was looking at that `config.log` file and finding and addressing what error was specifically mentioned in there. Since 3.5.x is not working for you, but did for me, I don't know specifically what is wrong, but my only recommendation is to find and inspect that `config.log` file.

Simply updating Xcode command line tools may also work. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I also ran into various issues when juggling between different Python versions, and eventually the approach suggested in https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/325 really helped to resolve the issue neatly by creating virtual environments using Anaconda, which would allow different Python versions to be run for different purposes. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I usually don't like cluttering up my MacBook with programming runtimes, packages, etc. Typically, I create separate VMs for that purpose. However, for MP1 I was able to run/debug all the python code using colab notebooks so I didn't have to install python or pip packages on my MacBook. This is roughly what I did.  1. sync GitHub repo folder from MacBook to Google Drive using Google Drive for desktop app. 2. mount Google Drive to colab, so you can access your python files in colab. Put this in a cell and run it. ``` from google.colab import drive drive.mount('/content/drive') ``` 3. To execute a python script in Colab put this in a cell ``` exec(open('PATH_TO_PYTHON_FILE').read()) ``` 
THREAD: Where are you guys doing the MP? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You can use any one which you feel confident to get the MPs done. Just be aware that there is specific version requirements for the MPs. For e.g. MP1 metapy wont run on any python but 2.7 or 3.5.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I feel the jupyter notebook works best for me since the cell design could help me easily test codes.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: VS Code for editing .py files.   Python shell, ipython, or JupyterLab/notebook for interactive exploration and testing so I can pause intermediate states (ex: see how token object returns different values with different parameters).  To execute .py files, I’m using terminal through iTerm on Mac or using terminal in VS Code where I can see other code and ReadMe in one view. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Jupyter notebook is good REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I used Sublime Text for .py files and Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration. I also tried using Pycharm for .py files. But it didn't support Python 3.5, so I had to switch to Sublime. Wondering if VS Code will be better than Sublime Text for .py editing.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Jupyter notebook is good but I personally prefer pycharm mostly because I like IntelliJ products as IDE  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think whichever you feel like using best suits you most. I like VSC since it includes Python version switching, terminals, Jupyter notebook, GitHub, and more extensions.

THREAD: Query Likelihood Probabilistic Model REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes, that is the assumption you make exactly!  If you're genuinely trying to achieve good smoothing and account for any range of input the use might throw at you, it is in your interest to use as expansive of a Collection Model or Background Language model as possible. (a bit of a spoiler though: in future lectures, they get into something called pseudo-counts, where you artificially add counts to the probability of words to make sure there aren't non-zero probabilities. Using this approach, you could add a probability value to every word that doesn't show up in the document model or collection model so that the probability isn't zero, but still make it smaller than the probability of every other word so that your can still retrieve documents when a more obscure word is queried). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Or the possibility of variations of a word with a similar meaning (i.e., car is not present but automobile is). Does WordNet take care of such things?

THREAD: Collection Model vs Document Model REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Short answer: yes, the number of documents is the distinctive feature. However, the reason we use each of them is also different.  With Probabilistic Models (models with a probability distribution for the word frequencies), the document model simply refers to the relative word frequencies for a single document. While you could theoretically have a "collection" of a single document, that kind of defeats the purpose of using a Collection Model.   We can use a Document Model to determine many things about the text within a document or the author. In order to determine these aspects, we have to get rid of the "noise" from the single document.  The reason we use a collection model is to get rid of that noise. We "smooth" the word probabilities associated with the Document Model (since not all the words that might come up in a query could possibly be contained in one document) and we account for commonly occurring words like "the" so that we can get rid of background noise in our Probabilistic Models. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks for the answer and it helps.  Further question. If we want to "smooth" the word probabilities, why not use the Background Language Model instead? Could you elaborate in what situation the Background LM vs Collection Model would be more appropriate? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I'm assuming that the background LM has a lot of stop words whereas the collection model is more specific to the topic we want to model.

Run `pip freeze | grep metapy` from your terminal. Mine is  `metapy==0.2.13`. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Try again after renaming the file. Your Python file is also named metapy while you also import from metapy.   Python uses a concept called “namespaces” to separate contexts.  It is generally good practice to avoid naming files or imported modules in a way that conflicts with other existing names. You’re getting the error because your file “metapy” indeed does not have this attribute. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: Try again after renaming the file.

You’re getting the error because your file “metapy” indeed does not have this attribute. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: To say it differently, when you try and run the program from a file called metapy.py and then import metapy, the Python import search path first checks the current directory for modules of the name “metapy” before it checks for third-party installed packages (via system path variable).

Rather than executing in the command line (on your local machine), you can import corresponding modules in Python and work with them.

THREAD: Way to change size of subtitles on Coursera  REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: You can always download the notes and refer to the PDF when the subtitles are blocking the slide. That’s what I do. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 1]: I dug deeply into this last semester. The only way to do it (unless Coursera changed their displays) is to download the video and play the subtitles in a video program that allows you to avoid overlap. Personally, I ended up using VLC and manually adding black space on the bottom so that I could watch videos white reading subtitles (after downloading all the videos with coursera-dl). REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Maybe you can download their videos and the subtitles file and then watch them in other video players. I think some video players allow their users to adjust the subtitles position. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: If you have Firefox, you can use the built-in [Picture-in-Picture](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox) feature to fix the video on your screen. It won't display the subtitles in the video, and you'll be able to scroll down the page and follow the transcript without the video scrolling out of your screen.  ![firefox-picture-in-picture.gif](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/6db7dc5f-8f47-4b2d-bdb6-9be9e6fefed6/firefox-picture-in-picture.gif)

I believe they will take all sorts of statistics into consideration, based on my prior experience for the courses which gave credit based on forum participation. Including but not limited to, questions, answers, upvotes and likes.  Probably they will not announce detailed standards, since it is hard to come up with one and it could negatively impact students just to answer questions in order to meet some certain number. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree with Kefan. Goodhart's law stated simply is “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  With that in mind, I think it's actually important that they don't divulge how the scoring will be done, lest people try to game the system.

Please try to find a group of students to work together on the project. The quality of work from multi-person teams is always much better (1+1 > 2 kinda thing). If you can't find a team after looking seriously for a while, then 1 person teams are allowed in that case.

THREAD: Question 8 + 9 on practice quiz 1 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: 8.  first case: A man saw a boy,   with a telescope.      second case: A man saw   (a boy with a telescope). 9. L2 distance of two vectors depends on both the magnitude and direction of the vectors, the magnitude of the vector is the length REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I guess my question is more how do you go about identifying syntactic structures. I guess I need to study the VSM model to know l2 distance?   Seems like you already know. I'm new to this stuff. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: 8. What they are really asking for when they say "syntactic structures" in this question is how many correct interpretations there are. Others pointed out the two interpretations of the sentence. Written with less ambiguity, the sentence may read:  "The man saw a boy through the telescope."  The cause of the ambiguity in the original sentence is something called a "squinting modifier", that is, a modifier which could potentially describe 2 or more items in the sentence. The squinting modifier here is "with a telescope", which could modify how the man saw a boy, or it could modify the boy which the man had seen.  Hope this helps, or at least doesn't confuse things more.     REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For "L2 distance", I do not remember it is mentioned in Week 1 videos (please correct me if I am wrong). I know this because it was covered in my earlier algebra courses, probably it is also assumed that you would know it as a prerequisite.  Some external resources in case you still need it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance http://www.improvedoutcomes.com/docs/WebSiteDocs/Clustering/Clustering_Parameters/Euclidean_and_Euclidean_Squared_Distance_Metrics.htm REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 8]: cosine similarity is defined as  $$s(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = \frac{\bold{x}\cdot\bold{y}}{||\bold{x}||||\bold{y}||}$$. It is concerned with the angle between two vectors - which follows from the definition of the dot product $$\bold{x}\cdot\bold{y} = ||\bold{x}||||\bold{y}||cos(\theta)$$. So it is just $$s(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = cos(\theta)$$  L2/Euclidean distance you are probably familiar with: $$d(\bold{x}, \bold{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i-y_i)^2}$$  it is our standard idea of distance.  here's a horrible drawing that may help with the geometry: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/a8753732-9298-449b-a58d-cb9f5fea6dd4/image.png)  consider vectors $$x_1, x_2, y$$.  $$x1, x2$$ are in the same direction but the magnitude of $$x_2$$ is slightly longer. Clearly the angle between $$x_1, y$$ and the angle between $$x_2, y$$ are the same, right? But the Euclidean distances to $$y$$, denoted by $$d_1, d_2$$, are different: $$d_2 > d_1$$. So magnitude influences the Euclidean/L2 distance but not the cosine distance, which again only cares about angle REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think it is just grammar and common sense. There are no clear rules (otherwise the computer can do it easily). If we have another sentence: "A man saw a boy with a girl.", then only one case makes sense. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: Thank you all for the useful answers to the two posted questions! I'm guessing the question about L2 distance must be a practice quiz question. If you don't know about this concept, please don't worry about it, though I think Bill Guo has given an excellent explanation of it!  In case it's a test quiz question, please do let us know. I haven't covered it in the lecture, so you are not expected to know this for answering any test quiz questions.  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I agree that L2 does depend on vector magnitude in the general VSM. But if we are only using the query terms as BoW vocabulary, then the L2 of query and document vector will be unaffected by document length, right? REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: yeah true, i think the question was implying a different text representation like tf-idf REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Syntactic structure ambiguity generally means there is more than one way to interpolate the structure of the sentence. As Rongrong said, one case is that "with a telescope" is an attribute of "a boy", and in the other case, "with a telescope" is an adverbial of "a man". Both are correct in grammar, and they are different in structure. How to identify, I think is generally using the knowledge of the language.   For your second question, L2 distance is a geometry/math definition. You don't necessarily need to get it from the VSM model, but the vectors of a VSM model have L2 distances between each.

REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: You seem to be using a system with an M1 chip based on the logs, which is not supported by python versions below 3.8. You have a couple of options now:  - Run the process using rosetta, to emulate x86_64 - Locally build metapy to run on python 3.8 / 3.9. I've created a forked version with the necessary changes here: https://github.com/rajk04/metapy/. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think I tried both, the first one returns the same error, and the second one says that `ERROR: metapy-0.2.13-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.` when I tried the last step. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: For the second one: are you linking it to a python installation built for arm64, or x86_64? For reference, the generated wheel has the name `metapy-0.2.13-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl` when built for python 3.9 + arm64 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: I think in this case it will be x86_64 as the name suggests. I ran the command again with `arch -x86_64` and the result is still the same. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Yes but it doesn't quite work....

THREAD: Do we need to schedule the exams on proctorU right now? 
THREAD: Semantic analysis of "John owns a restaurant" REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 2]: The challenge here is not the syntactic structure of the sentence, which is very clear, but the exact semantic meaning of the verb "own". Think about what we humans could (further) infer from this sentence. The inference of course is often based on the vast amount of common sense knowledge we humans have (e.g., when someone owns X, the person can also sell X). In order for a computer to fully understand the meaning of "own", the computer also needs to acquire a lot of common sense knowledge. So in sum, the point made here is that the deep understanding of meanings in natural language text is almost inseparable from possessing a lot of common sense knowledge. Teaching computers common sense knowledge is still very hard (often called "AI-Complete", following the term "NP-complete").  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thank you! I understand better now.

THREAD: Cannot access Google Sheet / faculty directory sign up for MP2 REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You probably need to change your email-id to your official educational id for access. You are currently signed in with your personal id. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: You might want to register a google account using the university email. But I guess the access is probably not yet granted since there's a month before mp2 is due. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: The issue is that I do not have a Google account under my student email. When I try to register normally through Google, there is only an option for @gmail domain.  When I try to sign in to Google using a student email, it says that the account does not exist.  I'm learning that there is a separate campus registration system for Google Apps that is turned off (for me at least) by default. Trying that now. REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 17]: Thanks folks.  I think the issue is that (some) students need to toggle Google App services through the university cloud services manager. This is separate from how you normally sign up for a Google account.  I was able to access the spreadsheet and my student Google account after the following steps.  ### Steps * Check your student "Cloud Dashboard" here:     * https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/cbdash/ * Toggle Google App Services to "On" * You will be prompted to accept Google Terms & Conditions * You will be redirected to a "Welcome to your Google account" page * Click Next and you will be redirected to Google Drive home page * If you are signed in on a personal account on another tab, you might want to go to Google Sheets, and toggle to switch users in the upper right Google Account menu. The university account should now appear if you followed the preceding steps.    ### Links * Getting Started with Google Apps @ Illinois     * https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=47599 * UIUC Student "Cloud Dashboard":     * https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/cbdash/  Screenshot: *Account Status toggled to off by default* ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a3aa370-c917-4993-b5cf-4e06585e7704/ee2a3cfd-be82-4b6d-adbd-802dff3a74f0/image.png)  REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: None]: Thanks.

THREAD: Intuition for building VSM framework REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 3]: I believe V is the set of all words in all documents, ie. the vocabulary of unique words.  If so, initialization may be: ``` V = {} for d in docs:      V = V.union(set(d.words)) ``` My quick take :) REPLY: [ENDORSED: True, VOTES: 2]: From my understanding, the bag of words consists of unique tokenized words from the query and the document, which forms the entire vocabulary list V. Each word in V will then be represented as a dimension in the simple initialization of the vector space model. REPLY: [ENDORSED: False, VOTES: 1]: The answers given already explained how to compute V, the set of all the words in a language, which, practically speaking, contains only the words in a collection of documents in our retrieval problem. However, I suspect that your problem might be in thinking that the query vector needs to be *matched* with a "bag of words", which is why you imagine there might be a vector that represents a "bag of words". If so, you need to think about only a query vector or a document vector; we are NOT talking about any other vectors. The words in V define the dimensions of a vector space.  In other words,  your statement "we have a bag of words initialized as a vector" is not correct; there is not such a vector involved.
