THREAD: Do we have quiz questions from chapter 7 to chapter 12 collected anywhere? REPLY: You can retake them in Coursera  
THREAD: 20 question test that you have an hour to complete. If you didn't have issues finishing the first test you won't have issues finishing this one. If you can do all the quizzes well without notes, you're practically guaranteed a good score. REPLY: Thank you! The test covers week 7-12 right? Nothing from week 1-6? REPLY: Nothing from 1-6 
THREAD: To help in our preparation for the second exam, I used what I learned in this course in terms of scraping, data cleaning and text summarization to create <https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/gunther6_illinois_edu/EvC5Rwh9g69CnsnJn48-oqcBy5bbwPHHu0ss2p-ZRYJq6g?e=1B4xyu|HERE> the six documents below: •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Slides consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Slides consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) For curiosity and if you have interest in summarization (I have a lot), I used a rate of 35% (I tried with lower numbers, but the experience was not so good). This was a good exercise. I tried different extractive and abstractive summarization algos, including some packages already available in Python and pre-existing models. Abstractive is the future, specially the different HuggingFace Transform algorithms, but it requires much more study, analysis, and tuning to find the right parameters for big text such as transcripts (it would be a good exercise after the exams). After testing different extractive options I decided to use a step by step process using NLTK and PageRank: pre-processing, word and sentence embedding, padding, similarity matrix, cosine distance and PageRank for the sentences. Feel free to provide feedback about the summarized results. REPLY: I'm curious about a few things.  1) Are the transcripts un-edited, i.e. straight from Coursera? 2)  Does the summarization make new statements, eliminate redundant statements in the transcripts, or something else? 3) Do the summaries still follow the sequence of slides? REPLY: Follow my comments: 1-) Yes  2-) it is an extractive algorithm. With giant texts such as transcripts I got better results (so far) using extraction instead of abstractive (generating new sentences)  3-) Yes, it follows the sequence of slides REPLY: Hopefully someone has extra time to give you feedback. REPLY: <@U016V2VURUH> I took this class a couple years ago and my final project was also based on summarisation :slightly_smiling_face: . I had used TextRank which is based on PageRank for extractive summarisation. Also, you are right, for longer texts extractive approaches give better results but its also dependent to some extent on the datatset. I am in NLP at the moment writing a HW review paper on the recent advances in abstractive summarisation. REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0> this is a great topic and I am interested to learn more.

THREAD: I realize it’s a bit late, but is anyone interested in joining my project? It’s an active problem I’m working on at my job in collaboration with a team of student interns and open-source contributors.  1 page overview: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eyat5Aw6uPloQH8svH2M-g3fH3hH6UgXtxoojTL7pH0> Petal taxonomy: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840249663797723146/859519135313690664/PeTaL_Taxonomy_v1_Dec_2020v2.png> Github: <https://github.com/nasa-petal> Project proposal: <https://github.com/nasa-petal/search-engine/blob/main/proposal.docx?raw=true>  Project Description: Build an information system for the following problem: How to identify biology papers that describe various biomimicry functions from a known list of 100 functions, and rank them in order of relevance to a particular biomimicry function. An example would be a paper describing how geckos feet enables them to cling to surfaces, should be given a high relevancy rank for the biomimicry function, “attach temporarily”.  We’ve tried a couple of text-classification approaches to the problem, and have a simple web UI setup, but the goal of this project would be to explore some of the text retrieval and mining approaches to the problem to see if we can achieve better relevancy of results. If we have enough time/people it would be nice to add a feedback piece using implicit feedback of clickthrough data. REPLY: Hey Brandon, I would be interested in joining your project. I’m in PST. would that work? REPLY: Great, I’m in EST but my schedule is pretty flexible, so we can probably make it work.

REPLY: yeah this should not be done while exam is not yet over. add more pressure to others REPLY: I just finished the exam. It makes sense the exam score distribution.  1. The weekly quizzes are really helpful. The exam is not far from the quizzes. But, you should be able to explain why incorrect items in questions are incorrect as well. In my opinion, the exam is asking whether you really understand the quizzes.  2. Understanding models is really important. You do not need to memorize all formulas, but should understand how they work and the meaning of parameters. Questions will challenge you if you cannot interpret them.

THREAD: The probability of A OR B is the sum of the probability of A and the probability of B because terms are mutually exclusive, I think. REPLY: yeah Mat, agreed. as per the answer this statement is not correct. trying to think why this can be incorrect, because if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect. REPLY: <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1082> 
THREAD: any idea why is this correct? REPLY: Yea. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) REPLY: makes sense Rahul. if the probabilities are not mutually exclusive then both first and third statement should be incorrect I guess. REPLY: In Uni-gram model, A and B are *independent events,* *not mutual exclusive event*.  *[Independent event]* If A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). For example, what you eat this morning is independent to what score you get in this exam, so P("you eat fish this morning and you get score 100") = P("fish") * P("score 100").  *[Mutual exclusive event]* if A and B are mutually exclusive event, A and B cannot happen at the same time. For example, P("today is Wednesday and today is Friday") = 0.  The first statement is true because in Uni-gram model, A and B are independent events. For example, in Uni-gram model, P("today is Wednesday") = P("today") * P("is") * P("Wednesday") = P("today Wednesday is"), so we don't care about the grammar or context.  The third statement is false because you need to subtract P(A and B). Assume that P(A) = 0.6, and P(B) = 0.5, if you don't subtract P(A and B), then P(A or B) would be 1.1, which is greater than 1. REPLY: Makes so much sense. Thanks <@U020GEPFQ7Q>  REPLY: no problem! REPLY: in unigram model p(w1)+p(w2)+...+p(wn) = 1 so P(A)+P(B) can't be bigger than 1 like 1.1 in your example REPLY: You’re right, thanks! Maybe P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3 would be a better example. P(first word is A or second word is B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.12. And P(first word is A and second word is B) = 0.4*0.3 REPLY: If the third statement is asking when you generate only one word, what is the probability that this word is A or B, then I think the third statement is true. Because in this case, event 1(get A in the first word) and event 2(get B in the first word) are mutually exclusive. So the probability would be P(get A in the first word) + P(get B in the first word)  I think the statements of this question is not clear enough and I’m little confused.

THREAD: I found myself getting a little depressed going through the Recommender Systems content. Nowadays, this is the technology that's being used to push conspiracy theories, quack cures, teenage self-harm, and other nonsense designed to break society.  Can anyone recommend links on ways this can be combatted? For example, are there recommender systems that are driven by more than just user clicks and ratings? What other criteria might they use? REPLY: Sorry, I don't have a good resource for you, but glad you're bringing up this ethical concern. Where do you think the responsibility belongs to address these concerns? Personally, if we say everyone is individually responsible (or for their kids), then I suspect nothing will be done unless it impacts someone's bottom line. REPLY: That's a great question. I'm not nearly as up on ethics as I should be.  Humans naturally seek communities, and a great way to make money is to point them to things they're already interested in. I wonder if some recommendations could be driven not only by clicks but by some measure of "high information content" plus "neutral sentiment". I bet few people would follow those recommendations, though.  For now, I'm curious to see how Facebook's Instagram issues will play out. Will there be lawsuits or legislation, and what effect would it have? My thought is "not much", but we'll see. REPLY: This would make for a good campuswire post. I'm sure the TAs and professor would be able to point to decent resources. REPLY: That's a good idea, thanks. I will.  I attended a session on AI ethics a while back. The speaker listed ethical principles that have a lot of overlap with the principles of human-subject research. For example, give your subjects information about the data you plan to collect on them, and allow them to opt out.  One new principle was model transparency. I don't remember if this applies to general model explainability, or the ability to show a user why a model recommended them a particular item.  In any case, the principles give the user the choice about what to participate in. But with things like recommendation systems there's an additional risk of encouraging addictive behavior. People rarely have uncontrollable cravings to participate in research studies, but giving someone a chance to get lost in echo chambers is much more enticing. I think any approach to addressing issues has to recognize there's an addictive component to current systems. Of course, if that's the component that makes companies money, it's going to take a lot more work to address meaningfully. REPLY: Let me start by saying, I love this discussion!!!! It's so easy to get into the weeds of solving problems, but not so much about the repercussions thereafter. Here is my rambling train of thought on the above.  The opt-in opt-out is probably the most simple solution to any system. Use my data, no don't use my data.... a sign in the front of the store, that says, smile, you're on camera... (e.g. amazon go stores). don't like the convenience, no problem, you can still go to WholeFoods.  Echo chambers are a real threat to citizenship, some countries may prefer it (e.g. China), but what makes sense for a free speech society. when is too much of a good thing (e.g. content I like) a bad thing. Let's say I like watching a particular genre of TV/Movie to the point of Binge watching. Should Netflix be forced to limit my subscription? Or is it enough to provide an on screen widget that tells me my viewing habits. (e.g. hours this week per show / genre, etc). Probably the latter could still make me watch less, but would it make me cancel my subscription, maybe? REPLY: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFRewkdDT2g> REPLY: I think it's also important to note that these positive feedback systems are creating echo chambers no only online in social media, but in any opinion-oriented medium. And not just explicitly opinion-based websites: look into Larry Sanger's (one of the founder's of Wikipedia) opinion on what the politically-oriented articles of Wikipedia have become). News websites (even formerly reputable ones) and social networks all drive people toward the same conclusion: people seeking confirmation bias because it feels good. From alcohol/drugs, to sex, to calorie-dense fatty/sugary foods, all the way to confirmation bias, our own primal desires push us to overindulge in these behaviors.  Specifically regarding the low-cost driven echo chambers: I suppose in past generations, the extent to which group-think was able to persist was primarily a function of the size of groups and cost of communication between potential members. Now that the cost of finding people who think exactly like you do is essentially zero, I don't know how possible it is to avoid the fractionating.  Another consideration I've thought about: to what extent is it moral to make people do something that they don't want to do, just because you think it will be better for them? Obviously most smokers are addicted to cigarettes and we know they would be healthier (and better off financially) if they didn't smoke. Does that mean it's moral to make them stop? I'm not entirely sure I know how to answer that question, but the similarities between that question and the question of regulating feedback systems is noteworthy. REPLY: Re: echo chambers, I thought Ground News’ curated “Blindspot for the Left/Right” concept was interesting in pushing up news stories that you’re less likely to see depending on political lean.  <https://ground.news/blindspot|https://ground.news/blindspot>  I used to follow pundits that I disagree with on Twitter thinking it would help with filter bubbles, but I don’t think this is a good approach anymore. Too noisy. REPLY: <@U012ZBEMAKW> specifically regarding "conspiracy theories", I'm very reluctant to think that it is a good move to stop any idea in particular because of one main issue: who decides what is a "conspiracy theory" and what isn't?  Remember when Covid definitely had a natural origin? (even though any honest actor knew the lab leak hypothesis was a plausible explanation all along). Remember when Iraq definitely had nuclear weapons? Remember when Assad definitely gassed his own people?  I could go on and on and on with dozens of major examples, but my point is pretty simple. Sometimes the difference between a conspiracy theorist and an unorthodox thinker is a few years passing. To think we've reached our zenith as humanity and that the intellectual elite will never be wrong about something in the future is naive. Preserving the ability to speak out--even if it is "conspiracy theories"-- is a necessity.  And perhaps more importantly, do you really trust big brother to never have incentives misaligned to the point that the person or group deciding whether something is "true" or not might have something to hide or a financial stake to buttress?  I know I don't. We have anti-pollution laws that have teeth specifically because we realize that the desire to keep you job and become more successful professionally is a strong incentive that has to be counteracted with a stronger punitive policy. In the same way, we should expect that the "fact-checkers" can have misaligned incentives at least occasionally.  There's a reason that the protection of free speech in the first amendment. REPLY: <@U028YQ2C0T1> I use ground news semi-frequently! I think it's a great resource! I especially think the most obvious bias becomes obvious looking at their website: omission bias. Looking at the different sides of the political aisle covering different things (e.g. team red covering the increase in illegal immigration and team blue covering the capital riot) makes the bias pretty obvious in totality. It makes you realize that there are (at least) two different realities emerging, predominantly brought about by the fragmentation of new coverage. REPLY: Maybe this rule is best: my freedom ends where harm to you begins.  As far as recommender systems go, the Instagram case seems like a good fit to this rule. Children don't have the same type of agency as older people, and Facebook appeared to know their product increased the risk of self-harm and other ill effects.  For adults, maybe the best thing is just to understand what companies use recommender systems to do: keep you clicking on their content as much as possible, no matter what. But that's easy not to think about, and so the US has quick spread of ideas like taking ivermectin for COVID or that voter suppression is needed to fight nonexistent mass voter fraud. (Voter suppression should count as infringement of free speech, if it doesn't already).  The case of Iraqi WMDs is an interesting one. The IAEA had found no evidence of Iraq reviving a nuclear program, but by that point the US media had echo-chambered itself into support for war. No Youtube needed!  I'd like to hear more about what issues other countries face. But now I'll stop breaking my rule to avoid politics in non-political forums. REPLY: I completely agree that children don't have the same agency as adults, but I don't know how reasonable that rule is for adults when the adults being harmed in this situation are consenting to the "harm." At least currently, that rule is inconsistent with how society treats other products (e.g. cigarettes, alcohol, fast food, etc). REPLY: but yes, I would be curious to hear the opinions of some non-Americans!

THREAD: Important announcement by Prof. Zhai in Campuswire pinned post yesterday regarding  change in policy for quiz deadline and penalty.  ```Dear All,   My apologies for the confusion caused by conflicting information in the new Late Quiz Penalty Policy post here and one of the TA answers in a previous question about Quiz penalties.   The confusion has mostly come from the somewhat different policies that we were expected to use for the online MCS students and the on-campus students in the mixed class. Historically, in order to accommodate the unpredictable schedules of our online MCS students, the department suggested removing all the late penalties for quizzes as long as the work was submitted before a "hard deadline". However, such a policy does not help students plan their work, often causing accumulation of too much work at the end. Moreover, it's also not the typical policy that has been applied to our on-campus students, which can cause confusion.   Thus we decided to revise the policy and give an "incremental penalty" for late submission of quizzes, which can help avoid too much work being potentially accumulated right before an exam.  Meanwhile, we still would like to do as much as we can to accommodate those who might have an expected challenge that would prevent them from finishing a quiz (or an MP) on time by granting extensions in a case by case manner. So if you have encountered any unexpected challenge or interruption in your study that affects your capacity of finishing a quiz or MP on time, please do request an extension by posting a "private note" on campuswire with an explanation of your situation.   Unfortunately, I didn't communicate clearly with all the TAs about this. Sorry for this confusion.   Due to this confusion, we will not enforce the New Late Quiz Penalty for Quizzes 1 through 4; for those quizzes you can still submit your quiz and receive full credit up to the Hard Deadline (end of Week 7).   For Quizzes 5 onward, however, the New Late Quiz Penalty Policy will be enacted: if you submit your quiz before the item deadline on Coursera, no penalty is deducted. If you submit your quiz after the item deadline but before the Hard Deadline, a daily penalty of 5% will be deducted. Please note that this new Late Quiz Penalty Policy only applies to Quizzes! The MP Late Penalty will NOT change, it will remain 50% penalty after the deadline.   Thanks,   -Cheng``` REPLY: I'm still confused over this, does this mean we get penalized when we submit after the hard deadline (week 7)? Also we are currently in week 5, it would make more sense to let this be effective starting from quiz 6 onwards 
THREAD: <!here> if you agree to not have the deadline of quizzes and MPs on the same week as lecture and prefer 1-2 weeks after, please :+1: on my post on <https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/795>  Thanks.

THREAD: I completed the first week of Text Retrieval and Search Engines. How can I transfer this progress over to the for credit CS410: Text Information Systems course on coursera? REPLY: I just clicked through and skimmed everything and took the quiz. REPLY: I don't think it's possible to transfer the quiz grades. REPLY: I see, thanks REPLY: As David mentioned, you can't really transfer, but the videos are the same. You'll have to re-take the quizzes. REPLY: Allegedly you can contact Coursera and they can transfer it over (though I haven't tried it). But I ask you this. Which is more difficult: retaking a few quizzes or trying to get customer support to do an uncommon operation? REPLY: The guidance in the onboarding course is not super specific. It's in Week 2 "Progress Migrations" module. It says that you are welcome to re-submit but it does not look like there is an automatic transfer or anything. Might be worth asking MCS Support to clarify.  &gt; _If you decide to enroll early, you will be in a public course open to the entire Coursera global learning community. A student can complete one or both Coursera MOOC courses prior to  completing the Online MCS for-credit course. Any assignment that was  only peer or auto-graded for a previous Coursera MOOC version of a  course can be re-submitted when taking the Online MCS offering of the  course for consideration by the faculty and staff to satisfy the  requirements to confer university credit.  However, for-credit course  content may be revised and updated for course improvement, making  previously completed MOOC assignments no longer compatible with the  degree requirements.  In such instances, students will be required to  complete the current assignments to fulfill requirements for the  for-credit course they are enrolled._ <https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcsds-orientation/supplement/w6l9Q/progress-migrations> REPLY: <@U029JEHM6MA> I looked through a few of the quizzes, and they seem to have different questions, so I doubt you can now transfer over quizzes, even if you used to be able to. REPLY: <@U029JEHM6MA> any another pro-tip: you only have to watch the last 5 seconds of a coursera video to get the green checkmark (watched video status) next to the video (not having a full column of green check marks always irritates me lol) REPLY: Thanks everyone. Yeah I think it's easier to just speed through everything by hand.

REPLY: The assignments were library agnostic when I took the class in 2019. I didn't use metapy at all. REPLY: Thanks <@UM1KDMWG0> REPLY: Was the course in Python or C++? REPLY: <@U01H3UFLBK5> python 
THREAD: Hello All...I am starting as new student in Fall 21...I was thinking of taking AML but heard it is ideal to take stat 420 before that...now I am thinking of taking 410...do I need to have any pre-reqs for this course in terms of probability and statistics? I saw the course catalog and it mentioned a pre-req for data structures REPLY: High school level probability and statistics should be enough for this course REPLY: thanks <@UM1KDMWG0> REPLY: Hi <@U0290ERJRBR> I'm also taking 410 in the fall. I wanted to take AML also, but I think it's all full. REPLY: <@U029QBMAUC9> It looks like there are around 250 seats available in AML: REPLY: Thanks <@U029CPHNMAP> I just switched. I'll be taking TIS and AML together, then. REPLY: Are you also taking those two? REPLY: :+1:yep REPLY: nice to meet you then! REPLY: from what I read this should be an easier intro to the program. REPLY: good to meet you too! 
THREAD: Does anyone have an updated syllabus for this course? Please kindly share. The one on the website seems outdated. REPLY: Here is the syllabus from the last time the course was offered, in Fall 2020. REPLY: <@U013T91B259> Could you please share your course experience? I am thinking about taking it in Fall 2021 and would like to know a little bit about the workload and time commitment that this course requires. Thanks! REPLY: Sure. First, here is another student's perspective: <https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/kd9uj0/review_of_cs_410_text_information_systems_fall/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share|https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/comments/kd9uj0/review_of_cs_410_text_information_systems_fall/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share> REPLY: I mostly agree with this. The course is exceptionally well-structured, and covers the basics of both Text Retrieval (searches) and Text Mining. I recommend it.  I took it in conjunction with AML, and had no problem keeping up in both classes. 410 took probably 8 - 10 hours per week on average. REPLY: Paul Nel graduated in 2019, but he tracked every minute he spent in every class, and for 410, he spent just over 120 hours total, which averages out to a little over 7.5 hours per week.  So that's roughly in line with what I spent on it. REPLY: Thanks Bob! I appreciate your input. REPLY: <@U013T91B259> I am searching for reviews on Data Curation and Scientific Visualization as well. If you have any links for those, could you please share them too? REPLY: I don't really have anything much on those.  You can search that subreddit (<https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC_MCS/>) and see if there's anything in there.   In general, I know that Sci Viz contains some pretty serious difficult math as part of the 3D visualizations -- it's more of an advanced graphics course.  Data Curation is supposed to be a low-stress, low-workload class that you can pair with just about anything else.

Accomplishments is in a dropdown menu when you click your account name in the top right of the page. I found my grade towards the bottom of the apge REPLY: Does anyone know if extra credits are supposed to be part of the percentage seen on the 'Accomplishments' page... or are they reflected separately in the transcripts eventually?

THREAD: Did anyone downloaded the videos for this course? Can it be shared? REPLY: i think the videos are probably the same as the public MOOC... REPLY: It depends on the prof. If it's already publicly available, it's probably ok. But some professors dislike you sharing material that they put a lot of effort into creating. You should probably ask just in case.

THREAD: Congrats to the top-rankers! :tada:   From Bhavya in Piazza:    Dear students,  Here are the final leaderboards for the IR competition and the Text Classification competition. We took the max scores per team to determine the ranks. The "Score (out of 45)" column is the score computed as per the formula stated in the project guidelines. The "Score for CMT" column should be used by the reviewers for answering question 4 in the reviewer form on CMT. We've also added links to these spreadsheets in Q4 on CMT.  Please let me know if your submission is missing from the spreadsheets or if your scores are not correct.   Congratulations to everyone on the great work, especially the top-rankers!!  #pin REPLY: what CMT 10 score means and any additional score for top rankers? REPLY: CMT 10 is for the source code, this is equivalent to 45% of project total score. In addition to that, top-ranker will get 10% as extra point for beating the competition baseline. 
THREAD: For the ones who took competition project, in the final submission along with documentation and code do we have to submit the answer.txt as well? REPLY: Yes.  I submitted answer.txt. My demo code/videos is basically to re-generate the answer.txt using the trained model. By submitting my answer.txt, I hope it will be easier for the reviewer to follow along with the demo code/video. REPLY: I think TA mentioned in one of the question that you can keep the answer.txt in your private repo and everything else in public repo. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=993|@993> REPLY: As ranking is already out hence answer.txt can be checked-in to public repo REPLY: Thanks your inputs guys, will check with TA if it’s allowed to submit the file now as the deadline is already over

THREAD: anyone here was able to get *ExpertSearch* to run successfully locally? I'm banging my head against the wall on this one! The dependencies have multiple conflicts with each other and `metapy` is not available for *Python 3.8* REPLY: <@UM44LTPJM> I was able to get this running on my Mac. I used the Python 2.7 version of pip to install the dependencies, but I needed to explicitly choose which gunicorn I wanted: ```/Users/mpigott/Library/Python/2.7/bin/gunicorn server:app -b 127.0.0.1:8095``` 
THREAD: Anyone remember how to solve the following (Q9, #2). I never figured out the wording and I dont see anything on piazza REPLY: Think of this like a decision tree.  Step 1 is choose a model (1 or 2).  Then choose the probability of the words coming from that model. REPLY: (probability of choosing model 1)(probability of choosing word 1 in model 1)(probability of choosing word 2 in model 1) + (probability of choosing model 2)(probability of choosing word 1 in model 2)(probability of choosing word 2 in model 2) REPLY: That is the answer/solution to the first question in this set I thought REPLY: That one is that formula, but that isnt the solution for #2 REPLY: Sorry, I took the exam on Nov 23rd and this is fuzzy now REPLY: No worries, i dont think i ever figured out what the TAs/Professor was even asking in this question. REPLY: Try this: (Probability for Model 1) * (Word 1 probability for Model 1) + (Probability for Model 2) * (Word 1 probability for Model 2) REPLY: Then multiply that quantity against the equivalent quantity for Word 2 REPLY: Ah! There we go, I understand what they are asking now REPLY: Hopefully that gets you the right answer!  I think the concepts were explained more thoroughly in the first half of the course REPLY: Very strangely worded. REPLY: As I said, I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think that's the right answer REPLY: It is. THe question was just worded weirdly imo REPLY: Yay! REPLY: my brain needs to solve these questions thinking on either topic mining where docs are generated sampling from many topic models, Or clustering where we need docs generated from only one topic model. Then I decide where to add p(theta) in the formula. REPLY: Not sure if this comes too late considering today is end for final, the Exam 2 guide by TAs has good explanation or atleast how to arrive at the solution. 
THREAD: I am confused by the grading criteria for the final project. On Coursera it says the majority (~90%) is graded on completion. But when i asked TA, he/she answered otherwise… Does anyone ask the same question before? REPLY: I had asked a similar question quite some time back. They told me that it is mostly completion based (~90%). The same is also mentioned on Coursera... I guess.  REPLY: Thank you! I guess i will just do my best to complete the project. REPLY: Something doesn't sound fair in that way of grading: I could have planned less functionality and completed my project. But I wanted to stretch myself by planning more features and do as much as possible - unfortunately, ran into many setup issues on Windows (since the Educational Web was only tested on Mac &amp; Linux) and will probably be completing only ~ 50% of what I had listed in the project proposal. The amount of effort spent has been more than double of the minimum of 20 hours. So if we go strictly by whether the project was completed, I will be penalized for trying to do more. I'm guessing the evaluation will be more fair and look at the context, details, efforts, etc. in addition to just the % of planned work completed...  Thanks! REPLY: I'm pretty sure 90% is completion. 10% is based on how your peer reviewer grades you. REPLY: I think the phrase "graded based on completion." is the confusing part - it appears for project proposal and progress report too. The Coursera project overview page (<https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/fTuOi/course-project-overview|Course Project Overview | Coursera>) says "Thus, your course project work would be *graded primarily based on your effort*. If you have followed our guidelines and completed all the required tasks, you should receive at least 90% of the total points for the project." All the required tasks here are the tasks outlined such as proposal, progress, documentation, code submission, etc. "Upon completion" implies upon completion of all these tasks. REPLY: I think Michael is right. 90% of the project is “when you done, you automatically got 100% “. So at least you do something, then you got 90% of project. But the rest of it will be depended on how good your project really is. REPLY: The 90% of the project is a fair point, assuming source code, documentation and demo video are provided. For the competition projects, if you beat the baseline you’ll get 10% extra credit. As if you get the project done 100%, as long as you beat the baseline. REPLY: Another word: 90% completion + 10% is for the quality/performance of the project (such as beating the baseline).  
THREAD: It’s said there would be one more extra credit opportunity. Anyone heard of anything? REPLY: Hi <@U011PK87A69>, it has been released already. Piazza post @1323. About Lecture Concept Preview. I am not aware if there is a newer one than this.  REPLY: So first the video subtitle fix then this concept preview. I am not sure if you are referring to another new opportunity after these two? REPLY: If you read the end of concept review, it says there will be one more. REPLY: Yeah I think there is supposed to be one more yet, but it hasn't been announced... maybe post a new thread on piazza? REPLY: I checked the thread it seems gone. Not sure what’s the plan now. Probably people did pretty well on final so they decide to let it go. REPLY: well this post says there will one more extra credit opportunity coming up <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1323> REPLY: How can i invite someone to review for this <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1323>?

THREAD: Anyone working on the ExpertSearch system? I am confused on how we can update the datasets REPLY: Yeah, it's confusing.  All of the scripts to build the inputs are in the `extraction` directory, and then you need to run the the `write_file_names.py` script to build the metadata.   Finally, you need to delete the contents of the directory containing the current index (`/data/FacultyDataset` if memory serves) so the index can be rebuilt. REPLY: Thanks <@U01249Y9STH>! So I am trying to add new faculty members to the dataset. So far my code only add new .txt file to the /data/compiled_bios folder and update data/emails to include new faculty members. I guess then I need to run extraction/extract_names.py, extraction/get_location.py, write_file_names.py then delete /data/FacultyDataset?  I also couldn’t find the script to update data/depts and data/unis. Do we need to update them manually? REPLY: <@UMC66KL9G> - we weren't adding new bios (just expanding on the current ones), so I didn't notice that the extraction scripts for departments and universities were missing.  If I were to guess, I'd say those came from this spreadsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198HqeztqhCHbCbcLeuOmoynnA3Z68cVxixU5vvMuUaM/edit#gid=0> REPLY: And yes, step 1 is to run the extraction scripts on the bio .txt files to update the input files that are fed into `write_file_names.py`. REPLY: I see, ok then I will try it first. Thanks! <@U01249Y9STH> REPLY: Sure thing - good luck! REPLY: It works! I have to change some of the scripts though to fulfill my needs. Thanks <@U01249Y9STH> REPLY: Sure thing - good luck!

THREAD: Any feedback on the final exam? easy/twisted? REPLY: it’s fine around same level as midterm, i found it easier tho REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> thanks REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> did you do well on the midterm? REPLY: Yeah I got a 90 on the midterm and 100 on the final. I mainly studied the provided study guide and the quiz answers. REPLY: Also maybe completely irrelevant but I always take like a 30-50 minute break before exams to just relax and absorb all of the studied info, definitely may not work for everyone but figured I’d say so in case it is something that may help others. REPLY: Oh, lol, I forgot what channel I was in!  I also got a 90 on Exam 1 and 100 on Exam 2.  Agreed that the second test was a little easier than the first test.  I also went on Coursera for Illinois and I enrolled in the Text Mining &amp; Analytics course there, and took the quizzes until I got 100% on all of them.  Those questions carried over well to Exam 2. REPLY: Lol fair but yeah same REPLY: It looks like reviewing practice quizzes is not needed, correct? REPLY: <@U01933GQP0S> what does that 30-50 minute break look like? Meditation? Listening to music? Playing video games? Study like a wild banshee? REPLY: Any question needed calculation? REPLY: Yup, similar to the calculations in Exam 1 REPLY: Ezra it's usually to avoid the last one so definitely not that one lol. Usually I just like to listen to relaxing music and close my eyes and just try to not think about what I've studied. I do this because I used to cram really hard up until the last minute and noticed that would give me a lot of test anxiety and make it harder to remember everything I learned. I think of it as an absorption and digestion period where my brain has some time to just prepare.  i can't tell you it has made my grades a lot better but it definitely has made me feel more relaxed and like I understand the material a lot more REPLY: &gt; I also went on Coursera for Illinois and I enrolled in the Text Mining &amp; Analytics course there, and took the quizzes until I got 100% on all of them. <@U01249Y9STH> Cheers, this was really good advice - gave me additional practice with new questions/answers and was good prep for the exam. REPLY: 1 hour 20 questions? REPLY: Yup.  I didn’t need that much time. REPLY: Thanks a lot for the feedback, guys. It was really helpful for my preparation. 
THREAD: Does anyone else's progress report peer review mention reviewing the presentation and source code submissions? Um...the progress report definitely didn't require the video presentation to be completed, so full points in this section?? REPLY: Hi Casey, check out pizza post @1330. This is what TA said:  “Please submit the review so that the authors can view your feedback. You can fill in any random values for the questions not related to the progress report.”  Source and video are not related at the moment for progress report review.  REPLY: Just need to fill out questions 1 + 2 according to TA on piazza 
THREAD: Anyone felt the final project is a bit out of control (we chose to reproduce a paper and found not so many libraries are out there to support us)? Or just me? Also I wonder how generous the final project has been graded in past semesters? REPLY: I'm doing a free topic and it is not out of control, but about 25 hours in I don't feel like I have accomplished that much and I haven't even spent time on setting it up to demo, or pulling my results together.  I did not ever expect to 'finish' as it is pretty open ended, but I did expect to get more meaningful results by now. REPLY: Tbh the grading seems pretty lenient, they made it seem like as long as it appears like you put in the work (20-25 hours per student) you will get at least a 90/100. Even regardless if the code works or not, which seems to be the last 10/100 points. REPLY: I am kinda regretting not choosing a free topic…. REPLY: I do wish the instructions were in one location instead of spread across Coursera, Google Docs, CMT, GitHub repos, etc. I feel like I'm missing something in the final project because part of the instructions were in one place, and the other part are in a second place. In Coursera it didn't mention the progress report required a source code submission, but now I'm doing a peer review and it's asking me to check if they submitted source code to review. Wat?? REPLY: You can just ignore that for the progress report. I agree in general everything spread out on Coursera and Piazza etc is a pain 
THREAD: i wonder how much extra credit could be earned in past few semesters for this course? It seems they are planning to release at least 2%… REPLY: In Piazza, Bhavya said the extra credit of MP2.4 is up to 5%:   ”You can calculate the extra credit yourself using the following formula: max(0, 5-(Rank-1)/10). So, you can get up to 5% extra credit, which means 5% of the final grade. Students with the same NDCG score get the same extra credit.   The grading formula on Coursera doesn't allow the overall sum of scores to exceed 100%. So, the extra credits will not be visible on Coursera. We will manually add them to your final grades.” REPLY: 5 (MP2.4) + 5 (Piazza) + 2 (Misc)  = 12% is the maximum REPLY: 5 + 5 + 2 == 7. Roger that. REPLY: You see, this was all crafted very delicately to create a lesson for my fellow peers.

THREAD: Hello guys, do we need to create another submission on CMT for the Progress report? REPLY: If I'm reading the instructions correctly, you add it to your existing CourseProject fork REPLY: Yeah, we definitely need to push it to our github repository. But, do we need to do anything else in the CMT tool? REPLY: There is nothing in the instructions to indicate anything needs to be done in the CMT tool.  Feel free to ask on Piazza though. REPLY: Thank you Michael, for some reason I thought we had to create a new submission on CMT for each milestone. REPLY: Do we need to submit it on coursera also? REPLY: Yes, it says in the screenshot “Then click the Submit button here.” REPLY: Yup ! Just git push your progress report to Course Project —&gt; Back to Coursera page and click “Submit”. That’s it.

REPLY: Yes the focus is on core intuition. Any calculation indicated as you “must” know in the exam guide is important. Quiz questions provide definite and helpful hint regarding what to expect.

I signed up for the audit course under the Coursera for Illinois heading and have been going through all of those quizzes REPLY: <@U012EG45HKJ> Thanks for the information. I was thinking whether I need to read the text book before scheduling. REPLY: I personally studied by going over the lectures and practice quizzes. The doc on piazza with the topics was also useful REPLY: Hi Shyam, is it safe to say we can skip the OPTIONAL video lectures to ace the exam 2? I see some conflicting messages about the OPTIONAL lectures are actually in the weekly quizzes. Not sure if this will be the same case for exam 2? REPLY: The content from the optional lectures wasn't on the exam (I skipped them while studying) 
THREAD: Hi everyone, I submitted my tech review and LiveLab shows score 1, but Coursera status does not change to Submitted. Is that expected? REPLY: I would commit some insignificant change, and push.  I had one time where the hook didn't work properly, and the second attempt did. REPLY: (I'm not sure which assignment it was.  It may not have been the tech review.) REPLY: Try to enter from Coursera submission page to Live lab once more. Should appear then. Also, in case even in this case will not appear - try to submit once more REPLY: Thanks guys, I had never clicked on "Open Tool" in Week 11 - Tech Review page as all information was available in Week 1. Which means the Coursera never marked it as "Started", thus not allowing the change directly to Passed. To resolve it, I clicked on "Open Tool" then made a small commit, it worked :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: See also <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=602_f12> 
THREAD: i have &gt;400 unique vocabulary in the third shape of it, not 6 REPLY: which dataset are you running against? REPLY: hi Peter, ignore DBLP.txt and concentrate on test.txt. 6 unique words is for test.txt which is good enough to pass the grader. 
THREAD: why are everyone's matrix shapes x, y, 6?? REPLY: In the test file, there‘s only 6 unique words (vocabulary size)

THREAD: Now, I don’t even see my submission in datalab after I do _git push_ REPLY: I had to basically re-sign up for livedatalab. I think my account got unlinked / delete?  After re-linking my account (new github access token) the webhook started to publish results.  Seems like something funky is up with the accounts :man-shrugging: REPLY: oh!! ok.. probably, that could be the reason.. REPLY: Thank you, will try that.. REPLY: Thank you very much Nate.. It worked.. now I am able to see the submission history.. 
THREAD: Guys if the status of the project proposal still Awaiting Decision on the CMT does that means that they haven’t reviewed it yet ?  REPLY: Not sure if this will help. This is what I can see in my CMT. I can see the review and the score already.  REPLY: Y just say awaiting for review  REPLY: I guess they haven’t reviewed  REPLY: <@U018K2P26MR> was your grade in coursera too or just CMT? REPLY: Just CMT. Coursera is not updated yet with grade. Not sure if this is normal.  
THREAD: Any one know how much the base line for the text classification competition is like? just want to be prepared at least mentally... lol REPLY: Baseline f1 is 0.723. REPLY: Thanks! 
THREAD: Below is my understanding on E-Step Normalization: Given a 3D matrix for example like the one below, where the level 1st dimension determined the topic &amp; the next two dimension representing the word &amp; doc respectively, is the normalization correct?    E Step:			 topic	w=1,d=1	w=2,d=2	w=3,d=3 0	        0.20	 0.30	0.20 1	          0.10	0.10	0.10  Or would the normalization be expected between topic &amp; document separately? For the E-Step we are considering 3D matrix &amp; I have read the resolution from the professor saying, two of the cube slices needs to be normalized. When I applied the formula as in the reference document, this is what I am getting. But my likelihood is diverging instead of converging. &amp; the doc_topic probability is just random. So I doubt if the E-Step is right.  There are lot of messages in Piazza, but still have no clarity about this. REPLY: Note that I havent passed yet, but first I was normalizing by column (so P(topic0, w1) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.1). I asked a TA yesterday and it seems the TAs have two normalization steps where they first do that normalization then _also_ do a normalization across a topic for all the words at the very end. So p(w1, topic0) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.2). I would like to hear how others did it as well. REPLY: For normalization I was also confused, but I attended one office hours, and figured out that for E-step and M-step in the denominator of the formulas the normalization already present. One sum for E-step, and double sum for M-step both formulas - all that give you normalization. So you have the option either to write this sum in the denominator of your formula, or apply propose normalization function to the upper part of the formula, and receive normalized pi and probabilities REPLY: For E-step I calculated sum as it was 3 dimensions and I was not sure how well the normalization function work, and for M-step I applied the function. REPLY: For each doc and for each word in it, you should do normalization across topics (columns) such that the sum of each column should be 1. Normalization for each row is not required. Hope it helps you.. REPLY: Thanks Marina; I did as per the above formula but I don’t see the likelihood converging. Checking if there are any bugs;  Thanks Vijay that helps; let me try that way  REPLY: Tried both these and it is converging sometimes and diverging sometimes. Did this happen to anyone? I am testing with around ten documents; 50% of my runs are converging and others diverging.  REPLY: did you submit to livedatalab and see any errors there? REPLY: No errors but no score REPLY: Try to check if the normalization really happen. Print out sum( P(z = j) , axis equal to the axis of topics) and see if you will see ones everywhere. For formula on the pi - sum over the axis of documents. For formula p(w|Theta) summarize over the axis of vocabulary. In case if in any case you will not see 1-s everywhere, you need to check if the normalization formula application is correct REPLY: Thanks Marina; I figured it out; the normalization was happening but I had a bug in log likelihood which was  actually hindering the convergence;  
THREAD: Hey Fellow CS410's. The tech review got extended by 1 week. <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=1045> Stay safe out there folks. REPLY: Tried it too hard but finally got some response :sweat_smile: 
THREAD: Did anyone else get stuck at log likelihood of -1364.4893899729557 and couldn't get out of it? I seem to get to that point fairly quickly, but get stuck there. REPLY: The value has to be negative but I got biggest  number like -15000  REPLY: What log are you using?  REPLY: This is good, kindly check difference using eplison and that will lead to converge (' Log Likelihood after iteration ', 18, '-1334.1393977467312') REPLY: PLSA can converge to many locals depending on initialization. Global converge is optimize solution. -1334 is better than -15K REPLY: Log likelihood for my 1st iteration was at -17k. And it got converged around 115th iteration in my local. When I submitted the code for grading, it got converged at ~ 25th iteration itself and passed. I don't think the log likelihood value doesn't matter as long as it converges at some nth iteration. That was my understanding. REPLY: I used np.log in my log likelihood function so I think that's correct. I think the issue may be in my e step normalization: I'm normalizing on topic columns as many have suggested but it's not working for me. But it could also be my m-step normalization is off. Anyone have any tips on how to debug? I've been stuck debugging all week but can't make much progress as I'm not sure what to compare against. REPLY: Actually nevermind: I got it to pass just now. My E step and M steps were correct, but I had an issue with word counts per document and accidentally removing the first word from lines 100-1000 because my method to read data from the file was removing that number from lines 1-100 but my try/except was erroneously still removing the first entry from the line for lines 100-1000. 
THREAD: Nvm I found the issue  REPLY: <@U0147TVTF5E> I am getting the same error. What did you do to resolve it? REPLY: Hi I got the error because I was using the test. Text path instead of the variable that they gave us in the code also I got it bc when I was looping I was using the number 2 instead of the variable number_of_topics  REPLY: Ok. I am not doing any of those - I mean I am using number_of_topics and self.documents_path but still getting the error. 
THREAD: How many interaction does MP3 does in liveDataLab for the test.txt? Bc I’m getting this error  REPLY: Had same issue. Start checking one by one M-step and E-step, eliminating the source of the issue REPLY: For one of them there will be an error, bringing whole matrix to same values in each row REPLY: Thanks <@U012LLB5SHJ>  I already find the issue  REPLY: Omar, for me it finished in 25 iterations.... if you scroll up someone got it in 18 iterations REPLY: Don't get too hung up on the number of iterations - remember, we're all starting from random initial weights :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Yeah thanks I solved the issue and passed the MP3  
THREAD: Is our tech review not included in our final grade? REPLY: The tech review doesn't get graded, but it is required. 
THREAD: How long did it take the MP3 run for DLBP? It is running for last 2 hours. Is that how long it took? REPLY: Locally, it wouldn't run in any reasonable amount of time for me. On live data lab, it ran super quickly. REPLY: Live data lab doesn't run DLBP, I don't think.  I'm not sure what data it runs. How many EM iterations did it do in 2 hours? REPLY: Live data lab runs almost exactly the test.txt (I printed out the document from livelab). REPLY: Hi Savitha, I completed MP3 without even touching DLBP at all. I somehow believe grader is only using ‘test.txt’. If our code can achieve the convergence (considering epsilon) within less than (or equal to) 50 iterations, I think it will pass. REPLY: btw, use the first 100 records in ‘test.txt’ to evaluate your code (or numbers such as likelihood) REPLY: My code took whole night for one or two iteration on DLBP.txt and still running. I guess loops are not good. Anyone validated with numpy libraries how efficient they are? I will try to run my algo on powerful linux server Vocabulary size:30140 Number of documents:10835 Number of Topics: 2 EM iteration begins... Initializing... Inside initialize_randomly Iteration #1... E step: M step:  Log Likelihood after iteration   1 -12172240.74027438 REPLY: It really comes down to how many loops you are running.  My E and M steps are the slowest thing, and it's because I still have double nested for-loops.  I managed to do a 1D vector-wise dot product, but not 2D.  If you can even just convert the last loop to a numpy vector dot product (np.dot), that will probably help you a lot. Keep in mind, DLBP is not run by the grader.  You don't have to be efficient for their tiny data set.  You just have to be right.  It's very gratifying to vectorize the code, though, _if you have time_. REPLY: My code sconverged on the test file in 3 iterations. Does that seem possible? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> in my case it took 13 iterations when running locally on the test data REPLY: <@US1DJGCSH> my submission converged after iteration 18 within less than 13 seconds REPLY: I wonder if the grader just runs your estep and mstep one time and sees if you get the right results REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> it runs multiple times, but specifically it sounds like they are comparing the results (index max) of the document_topic_prob matrix based on a piazza question I made REPLY: Which post was that? At this point there is so much activity on MP3 on Piazza it is hard to sort things out there. REPLY: It was a private question here, "the autograder uses a different dataset that the one provided for you to test your code, it runs your plsa algorithm and then looks at how your code classified each document as belonging to which topic (taking the maximum document-topic probability as indicator that the document belongs to/covers that topic the most). If your code converges locally then doesn't succeed with the autograder, check how the code classifies the document in the test.txt file you're given, i.e. look at the converged self.document_topic matrix and see if it classifies the documents correctly.  Also, remember not to hard code anything in your code (use number_topics, not "2" for example), the autograder's dataset is different than the one provided for you." REPLY: thanks interesting 
THREAD: How did people end their `plsa` function? Curious if I am missing a return statement or what, i have no idea wht the autograder is getting triggered on tbh REPLY: I didn't return anything REPLY: I did return it. Both ways will work.  REPLY: oops, final project distracted me a bit. for plsa no need to return anything. sorry. 
THREAD: MP3 - I am not able to understand how epsilon is used in the program; can anyone please guide or point to some reference? REPLY: Slide 10 of PLSA Part 2 says: ```Computation of the EM Algorithm • Initialize all unknown parameters randomly • Repeat until likelihood converges``` What does "converge" mean?   It means when the likelihood of the model doesn't change very much from one iteration to the next.  What does "very much" mean?  You guessed it!  If the change in the model's likelihood is smaller than the epsilon. REPLY: Difference between Likelihood at iteration n and likelihood at iteration (n-1) should be less than epsilon to stop the likelihood calculation loop REPLY: Thank you! REPLY: Interesting. I didn't use the epsilon, but still passed. The grading must be somewhat lenient. REPLY: I don't think the grading cares if you converge or not, but then, I'm not sure what the grader is testing either. REPLY: grading might be using its own epsilon and number of iterations to converge based on the likelihoods generated REPLY: I guess that’s why question says we are free to modify main() as grader has its own way to check the code  
THREAD: What are some initial likelihood values people are seeing at iteration 0 on test.txt REPLY: <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C20U1T84T/p1603487876443800?thread_ts=1603468332.437000&amp;cid=C20U1T84T> REPLY: Sweet thanks, must have been buried in a conversation i didnt read through REPLY: If you scroll through that conversation, others had different (but still very negative) starting likelihoods REPLY: That is roughly what I am at. Still not passing w/ around -1400 in the autograder, looks like i need around -1300 REPLY: Did you keep around the removal of the 0's and 1's from the test.txt when you submitted? Im curious if my funkiness with that is what is causing issues REPLY: I kept the 0s and 1s - basically I split by tab first, and then I split the last element in the first split by space REPLY: You also have to be careful when splitting by space - you might accidentally absorb the newline character as one of the "words" REPLY: Ah okay, ill check it out, i didnt run the DBLP text because it just is too large. I wasnt expecting that to be the issue but i hope it is REPLY: Just print the first couple of lines; it should be obvious if you see `\n` as one of the words in the array. REPLY: Yeah, don't see anything - unfortunately. Means there is a bug somewhere else. Thanks for the help! REPLY: Good luck.  I am sorry that this MP doesn't give you a lot of guidance in the middle; you basically have to write a bunch of code and hope all of it's right. REPLY: Debugging large matrices is hard haha. Finding bugs when this look "close" enough is even harder REPLY: Yeah, I ended up using loops, because it was easier (for me) to translate the formulas into loops. REPLY: Someday I'll be smart enough to see how to convert those equations into matrices REPLY: Someday I will be smart enough to get it work in the first place =P 
THREAD: I finally succeeded to complete the MP3. I was not able to do M-step in matrix multiplications, probably sometimes next time:) Did it with double loop. For E-step I succeeded to do the single loop +matrix multiplication for the rest of dimensions (I'm not sure if we can avoid loops at all here, if somebody did - please tell). The most helpful thing was to write each step on the paper, indicating the dimensions, and the exact formula of each step. I think I never wrote so much during MP before:) REPLY: I feel similarly! I'm almost finished and wasn't able to work productively until I wrote out the formulas on paper in a way that was easy for me to understand. REPLY: if you do the calculation using log.. you don't have to use matrix multiplication and may avoid loop altogther.. this is what EM assignment in AML is doing.. haven't tried it for this assignment... REPLY: I  decided to start with formulas from this course as I started this assignment earlier than AML. Bthw - just found how to eliminate one of the loops in M-step. So I have 1 loop in E step and 1 loop in M-step. 
THREAD: Hi guys any hint on how to calculate the log likelihood for MP3? I think I’m applying the log() in the wrong place, also do we have to return self.likelihoods?  REPLY: The log-likelihood function is discussed on Slide 6 of *`9.8 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA): Part 2` ... I needed to listen to that part of the lecture again to understand the equations I was looking at.* 
THREAD: I am having a little trouble normalizing my 3D matrix in the E-Step. Can anyone provide some pointers? REPLY: Hi, REPLY: Are you able to normalize 3D matrix in E step? REPLY: I used Michaels suggestion below and that worked for me. It will depend on your implementation, but if you are using for loops it should work. 
THREAD: I ran my stuff against DBLP.txt, needless to say, it was stuck on "EM iteration begins..." for like 10 minutes, before I killed the process. I decided to try my luck and submit anyway :laughing: good luck all! REPLY: I think building the term_doc_matrix is taking a while the way I did it REPLY: same here, I got test.txt to pass in the first attempt but I couldn't even run one EM iteration REPLY: luckily my submission also passed in livedata lab 
THREAD: How to decode submission error? I am getting following error during submission, how to resolve this issue? Currently I have tested my code on test.txt, do we need to validate code on DBLP.txt as well? _You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command._ _[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/azure/data/cs410/mp3_test.txt'_ _File "mp3_grader.py", line 81, in &lt;module&gt;_ _test_plsa.post_results()_ _File "mp3_grader.py", line 65, in post_results_ _raise Exception("GRADING FAILED!!!

I had several errors pop up in the grader because I was using Python 3.x instead of 2.7, which the grader uses. That _Permission denied: mp3_test.txt_ looks unfamiliar.  You could try making a small whitespace change and submitting again.  If the mp3_test.txt permissions problem isn't related to any file operations you do in your code, and a second run has the same issue, I'd send a private note on PIazza and see what they say. REPLY: Thanks <@UCC3KEKU7>, problem was resolved after removing following two lines from code #self.vocabulary.remove('0')             #self.vocabulary.remove('1') But now I am getting zero score, how to debug it further?

THREAD: Coursera is telling me I completed the Text Information Systems course.  Is this happening for anyone else? REPLY: I haven't seen that yet, but sometimes that happens with Coursera.  As soon as you have enough points to earn a passing grade, they send you that. REPLY: But now I can't use the Coursera app to play the videos on my TV through Chromecast! REPLY: My coursera looks normal to me REPLY: Why would you want to watch the rest?  You already passed! :laughing: Ok, I don't know about the chromecast.  Whenever this happened to me, I still had access to all the content. REPLY: Great job! :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I have received same message for my AML. Never had it before, seems Coursera made some changes on the portal REPLY: Wow ! Congratulations already :blush: But I guess Exam 2 isn’t open yet and Group Project is peer-graded at the very least. Not sure how Coursera came to the conclusion.  May be finished with all the lectures, quizzes and MPs. That may be the reason. REPLY: I finished all of the MPs, but I've been going one-week-at-a-time, and now I'm on Week 10.  It's so weird! REPLY: 60% course completion seems to be cutoff for AML and this happened to few students and few posts on AML slack. There may be a cutoff set by UIUC TIS course which might have triggered the message. All in all, it’s good :blush:

THREAD: Now that I revisited 1-6 chapters for Exam 1, I kinda fell in love with this course yet again. I believe I’m getting the big game of text —&gt; web connection and the GREAT game of retrieval and classification.   This course is kind of “Exploitation” (of what I know and tweaking a bit) vs “Exploration” (opportunities for learning more by exploring) compared to my other class AML. Anyone felt the same way?  Don’t get me wrong, Prof. Forsyth is a renowned Computer Scientist and well known and reputed in Computer Vision but somehow AML isn’t cutting for me. I’m not motivated to do the assignments to say the least.  This course on the other hand, I already have ton of ideas in NLP/Text that can be worked out as pet projects / product ideas / papers etc. Anyone working on any interesting text problems right now? It’d be awesome to hear from you. REPLY: Prof. Forsyth’s on-campus video is waaaaaaaaaay better. He explains things crystal clear and he likes handwriting everything down with pen and paper. For some reason, he used slides when recording online lecture… That’s why it’s a bit off to watch him reading slides. And again, I don’t dislike auto-grade assignment. But project is really needed for a course called “Applied xxx”. REPLY: Is there a link or slides for Prof Forsyth's on campus lectures? I would be really interested. REPLY: <https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/> This page contains videos for Trevor Walker's lectures in Spring 2019 and David Forsyth's lectures in Fall 2018. REPLY: I agree that Forsyth's recorded on-campus lectures are quite good.  Trevor's lectures are also good.  He has quite a few on neural nets later in the course REPLY: <@U011PK87A69> - Thanks Devin for the inputs. You are right. I checked the previous online 19,18 lectures and they are good in making us understand the core concepts. Somehow, I am disconnected with “Applied” part of ML in this course. I work in ML/Advanced Analytics group. I don’t see anything that we use in a pure enterprise grade setup. I appreciate the fact that “Applied” in the context of this course relates to building from ground up (like Numpy etc) but unsure if it’s worth the effort. To be very honest, Piazza and Slack is more helpful solving assignments than the textbook/slides. That’s the sad part for me. I guess we have to live with it.

THREAD: In the above example why is the unary portion `1110`  8 and not 4? REPLY: You don't need to know the log values for gamma encoding.  You need to know the _floor_ of log values.  Try a few out and figure out the pattern.  Also, <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=836> REPLY: Something else that may help: if the unary portion is n bits, the remainder will be n-1 bits. In other words, the remainder is the binary representation of the addend to the unary portion represented in n-1 bits. REPLY: So for 10, your unary portion would be 1110, which is equal to 8, so you only need to add 2, which we render in binary with three bits 010, so your gamma code would be 1110010 REPLY: extremely helpful, thank you both! REPLY: cool thanks guys! REPLY: One more thing, for Floor(Log2(x)) formula is  for any x, 2^k&lt;= x&lt;2^k+1 =&gt; so the value of Floor(Log2(x)) will be equal to k .  for eg: 6  2^2&lt;=6 &lt; 2^3 =&gt; so we pick the lower value ( floor) k which is 2.  n = 11  2^3&lt;=11 &lt; 2^4 =&gt; again lower k = 3  and with the link provided by <@UCC3KEKU7> you can verify this. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Yep, you've got it!  The formula on the slide, while technically correct, isn't nearly as nice as having the intuition of what that floor-log2 is doing. REPLY: In the above example why is the unary portion `1110`  8 and not 4? REPLY: IIRC (I took the exam Oct 5th so it’s a little fuzzy now) you count all the 1s up to the first 0, so 111 = 3; 2^3 = 8 REPLY: Where does 2^3 = 8 come from?  In another example `11001`  11 = 2 2^2 = 4 01 in binary = 2 2 + 4 = 6  Why does the lecture say this equals 5?  Am I missing something obvious? REPLY: 01 in binary is 1 in dec. REPLY: OIC. I've been doing it backwards :face_palm: REPLY: 2^(Number of 1s before 0) + (Binary code after 1s) REPLY: so to encode a number we just find the highest power of 2 and add binary to it? REPLY: Thanks everyone!  This was one of the final things I felt I needed to spend some time on before the exam. REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: I watched the video about piazza again and the professor is very clear to say "up to 5%" REPLY: I think in the intro video the professor said they will be counting how many postings each student made, and then determine the score based on the number of postings.

They are based on the grade points you have collected over the semester using this map shown here on the slide. Mostly it's five points for each bracket but not always. And as you can see, if you have earned 5% extra credit and when adding this extra credit, will likely help you move your grades up by one bracket, although it won't be more than one bracket. ``` REPLY: I asked it in the TA zoom after you left :stuck_out_tongue:.

My likelihood starts at -179413.22719749954 in the first iteration and ends at -158917.11630642737 in the 50th REPLY: Shouldn’t it converge before 50th iteration ? REPLY: Are we suppose to see 1 or 0 on the leaderboard? REPLY: yes, you would see 1 on the leaderboard.. i submitted mine few days back.., i was struggling with matrix multiplication and eventually settled for “for” loop.. now i have submitted, i am thinking to try matrix multiplication now… REPLY: <@UANGTNASY> mine didn’t converge before the 50th iteration, but it did converge in the automated tests run during the submission. REPLY: I was able to converge in less than 10 rounds but still couldn’t pass the test. REPLY: Finally beat the autograder although it’s weird to me... it didn’t converge... My loglikelihood is also far away from yours REPLY: The autograder converged on the 23rd iteration for me REPLY: Finally ... converged at 11th iteration :) REPLY: lol mine starts at -33000 and then just gets more negative... REPLY: are there multiple local maxima? try running with different widely spaced initializations? REPLY: I got it!!! That was a difficult one, but well worth it lol REPLY: This is very confusing, I'm pretty sure i have the right implementations so i'm not even sure where to start debugging :sweat_smile: REPLY: Mine did not converge locally or in the autograder, yet I got 100% :thinking_face: REPLY: so, if we go through Lectures, will we able to figure out the Formulas to be used in Assignment MP3? REPLY: Yes, that’s what I did.  I needed to listen to some of the lectures again in order to understand the likelihood formula, but otherwise, it’s all there. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> Thank you much. I am yet to start MP3. Looks like more coding.. Hope i will be able to finish before deadline REPLY: Hi, I haven't started MP3, how much time is required to complete this assignment after going through week 9 lecture/videos? Any hints for reducing inital bumps/no clue phase? REPLY: Working on likelihood tonight. Hope will be done with MP3 without much issues. Wish to finish this and go on to Tech Review. More excited for Tech Review although not adding any score.   My tech review is about - NLP Evolution - The Past, Present and the Future. Hope will finish and will share it with the class. 
THREAD: In case any gamma encoding question in the exam, how to we calculate the *log* values there? REPLY: You don't need to know the log values for gamma encoding.  You need to know the _floor_ of log values.  Try a few out and figure out the pattern.  Also, <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=836> REPLY: Something else that may help: if the unary portion is n bits, the remainder will be n-1 bits. In other words, the remainder is the binary representation of the addend to the unary portion represented in n-1 bits. REPLY: So for 10, your unary portion would be 1110, which is equal to 8, so you only need to add 2, which we render in binary with three bits 010, so your gamma code would be 1110010 REPLY: extremely helpful, thank you both! REPLY: cool thanks guys! REPLY: One more thing, for Floor(Log2(x)) formula is  for any x, 2^k&lt;= x&lt;2^k+1 =&gt; so the value of Floor(Log2(x)) will be equal to k .  for eg: 6  2^2&lt;=6 &lt; 2^3 =&gt; so we pick the lower value ( floor) k which is 2.  n = 11  2^3&lt;=11 &lt; 2^4 =&gt; again lower k = 3  and with the link provided by <@UCC3KEKU7> you can verify this. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Yep, you've got it!  The formula on the slide, while technically correct, isn't nearly as nice as having the intuition of what that floor-log2 is doing. REPLY: In the above example why is the unary portion `1110`  8 and not 4? REPLY: IIRC (I took the exam Oct 5th so it’s a little fuzzy now) you count all the 1s up to the first 0, so 111 = 3; 2^3 = 8 REPLY: Where does 2^3 = 8 come from?  In another example `11001`  11 = 2 2^2 = 4 01 in binary = 2 2 + 4 = 6  Why does the lecture say this equals 5?  Am I missing something obvious? REPLY: 01 in binary is 1 in dec. REPLY: OIC. I've been doing it backwards :face_palm: REPLY: 2^(Number of 1s before 0) + (Binary code after 1s) REPLY: so to encode a number we just find the highest power of 2 and add binary to it? REPLY: Thanks everyone!  This was one of the final things I felt I needed to spend some time on before the exam. REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: Hi Everyone, I need to take a break till Oct 31st. I will resume on Nov 1st again. I looked at all deadline and it feels like I’m not missing any deadlines. I finished my week7 assignment and Exam1. I’m yet to complete MP3. Need your help to ensure that I’m not missing any deadline. Thanks in advance! REPLY: I think the easiest way to check all deadlines is to go to the Grades page on Coursera. REPLY: Yes Joe, I did that. Everything seems fine to me. The next dead line is on Nov 8. But, Is that all? Is everything listed under Grades? REPLY: there is a tech review, which can take you all day, and there is a MP3, which can probably take the same (haven't tried yet, so comments from peers welcomed on timing). For tech review the deadline was last week to submit proposal, and for the project one - this week. At least the project proposal costs some % of total grade, so you won't want to miss it I think. REPLY: if you will submit project proposal this week and you will have entire 3 days to work on tech review, MP3 and quizzez till 4-th of November, you are good REPLY: Group Project Proposal - before Oct 25th. Tech Review -  before Nov 8 MP3 - before Nov 8 (please have some buffer) All quizzes from Week 7-12 - before Nov23  Bottom line - If you take care of “Project Proposal” you are good. Enjoy your off-time. REPLY: Hi Marina, My team and I are planning to submit the project proposal this week. Thanks for pointing out the tech review task. REPLY: Thanks Dheeraj for the dates! They are reassuring! 
THREAD: does proctoru pause/disable you if you look down? I know we are permitted two sheets of paper and I don't know if looking away from the screen to the paper on your desk will  lock you out REPLY: They can speak and stuff, so I guess they might warn you.  I did write on my sheet and looked around a bit (I am sure), and it wasn't any trouble. It should be fine as long as they can see your full face I guess. REPLY: They also have you use your camera to look around your work place before you begin your exam. So they will have some sort of understanding that you didn't tape a piece of paper to a wall or something. REPLY: They made me move my camera a bit so they could see me better, which made seeing my screen a pain in the butt REPLY: I think I'm going to buy a webcam instead of using my laptop camera because it really was difficult to see the screen at that angle. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> oh did they have you angle it downward toward your desk or something? REPLY: Yes, exactly. REPLY: How were they also able to see your face? REPLY: Oh just tested it out REPLY: I guess they need to see your head and the top half of your shoulders REPLY: And they were only able to see my face REPLY: It was only an issue for one test, but that test was pretty brutal without the additional strain of struggling to see my screen REPLY: For my cs519 midterm REPLY: Have asked me to show all the sides again in the middle of the exam. Just depends on the proctor.  REPLY: They asked me in the middle of the exam to readjust my camera, but were nice about it...e.g. keptapologizing. 
THREAD: did they ever share the quiz solution document? REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=654> 
THREAD: For MP3, the converged doc topic matrix, do we need to care about exact zero/one to be seattle/chicago ? Since I'm getting inverted result of zero one as compared to test file. REPLY: 0 is seattle and 1 is Chicago. You need to match your results with the doc to verify that what your are doing is correct REPLY: Let's say the 2 J topic columns are J0 and J1, so what you mean is J0 is seattle and J1 is Chicago. Then while J0 closes to 1 and J1 closes to 0, it is indicating the predication is Seattle ? REPLY: Did you figure out this issue? REPLY: Yes and it doesn't matter, as long as the one column is close to 1 while the other is close to zero.

Let me know if you're interested: <https://github.com/theRocket/CourseProject> REPLY: team name ERNIE REPLY: I often arrive fashionably late to the party and stay the latest, dancing my ass off 'til dawn!

"It reads sentences, takes the text and creates a mathematical representation of that text, such that sentences that have the same meaning map to the same thought," she said.

THREAD: I’ve immense admiration and respect for “Reckoner” #1 in the leaderboard and the numbers on each dataset are the top notch in the entire leaderboard.  Either he/she deeply understood the “Data” and how “BM25” works internally to the core and be able to tune or augment data/clean the data and feed the clean or “rich” data to BM25. I really wish this is the case and not just gaming the system having different set of params over fitting to each dataset.   Kudos to EVERYONE in Top50. Moving onto next chapter - “Text Classification”. See you there.   Oh by way, watch out for “Sarcasm Experts” on the Leaderboard. REPLY: I am reckoner :smile:, I can't promise you that I did not overfit But I was able to achieve #1(0.711, it would have been #2 now) by only changing the formula. I spent around 9 submissions more to tweak the parameters. REPLY: <@U018EJ65U5V> now that it is over. I'm assuming you made slight modifications to BM25? REPLY: Tho for the record, I think so it is still fair and exciting if people brute forced and reached near the top, and if it were a normal job, I wouldn't mind a highly tuned ranker for my particular dataset.  I  was able to try the entire family of functions, BM25, BM25L, BM25Plus and if people hadn't found out competitive baselines, it wouldn't have been fun trying newer models. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> Yes, the winning function was a modified BM25Plus, but I changed the query param (removed k3 param as it was useless (I think so from your own results you would be able to see that high values of k3 were useful, and if you look at the query normalization function, high k3 means, k3 was getting canceled out. REPLY: BM25plus taking from here: <http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/andrew/papers/2014-2.pdf> Our professor made it!! REPLY: <@U018EJ65U5V> I did the same as yours; ignored k3 first and then QTF overall ; it didnt matter; and added delta to IDF portion; but didn’t fine tune k1 &amp; b post that; curious to know what your k1 &amp; b are? Did you change anything else on the BM25 function? REPLY: I did use QTF, only removed k3 from that. I also used an if condition for ctd (if it is &lt;0, score = 0). Finally I used rocchio feedback on 80:20 split to get params. BM25Plus params I adjusted by hand, but the default params also got me the second spot. 
THREAD: For today's deadline all we needed to do was put an entry on the google sheet, right? REPLY: wait which deadline REPLY: tech_review REPLY: Tech Review. Yep. Can anyone confirm that is all that needs to be done REPLY: Yes, I would agree with you <@UMCB313QT>, it looks quite clear here <https://github.com/Bhaavya/tech_review> REPLY: Wow thanks for the reminder! I totally forgot about this! REPLY: Deadline for tech review is Nov 8 as far as i know. Github page says oct 18 , but there is a note in the end with the updated deadline. The same is updated in Coursera as well. 
THREAD: This is me right now REPLY: I am curious, did you make a script or were these manual submissions? REPLY: script REPLY: it would create a submission, and then check to see if the results have been updated. Log the results, next item. REPLY: nice REPLY: what's the logic for parameter updates? REPLY: I did a mixture of things. I created a function that does all of the above that would just be fed a ranking function + values. Then I utilized excel to look into trends and populate a long list of items that I wanted to get checked over a certain amount of time. If I was given more time on this assignment. I would have implemented a machine learning aspect. I could have also did like 20k submissions, but I didn't want to over do it. REPLY: I can do 1 submission in aprox 20-30 seconds. REPLY: I will say that there are a few trends that I saw that I was almost positive would result in a higher overall score, but then it would get to an x value and instead of a high number, the return looked almost random. 
THREAD: Any inputs about Exam 1? I have scheduled my exam for tomorrow. I went through lecture videos, quizzes and study material. Is that enough? REPLY: I think the exam 1 is tricky. There are a lot of high-level stuffs, which actually make the exam a bit trickier than i thought. It would’ve been a lot straightforward to do calculation IMO. But overall it’s not hard. REPLY: Agreed it’s not hard, but I wish I went into it with a better understanding of the Okapi/BM25 algorithm.  I earned 90% but I’m mad at myself for not doing better. REPLY: Thank you much..   <@U011PK87A69> When you say high-level stuffs, does that mean it had many theoretical questions? REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> 90% is good. Great. Hope i get decent score tomorrow REPLY: I am afraid i cannot tell you what exactly it looks like. But you have to understand each formula, why is it put together in this way? REPLY: Let's keep this fair by not giving any details about the exam until everybody's taken it. REPLY: I can say this without breaking any rule I guess: follow what is emphasized (must know &amp; able to calculate) in the readily published exam guide and you will do just fine.  REPLY: How much time should I spend reviewing? I scheduled my exam for the 25th. REPLY: <@UASMCKW3D> thanks. by exam guide do you mean  Week 6 Lession 6.1 Video : summary of exam 1  ?

THREAD: I'm coming for you guys :joy: REPLY: Have you automated your submissions? :smiley::joy: REPLY: Your overall score was already at 0.710 when you made the 1055th submission. It was the highest I've seen in the board. The current highest is 0.709 that's still below your score. I'm puzzled why you are still making the submissions. Are you trying to crash the server?:grin: REPLY: Poker Face REPLY: Gotta catch them all REPLY: There is better numbers out there and I'm going to find them :laughing: REPLY: Get that .8 in there!! Go! Go! Go! :grinning: REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> after the final, will you please share your thought process or you method of how you achieved the top? I tried different ways of optimization and I can get my local ndcg@cranfield up to 0.366, but I am still failing. REPLY: I really would like to learn how can I improve my search method. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> - Poof ! There it goes. Magic. Don’t see your 4 figure submissions anymore :upside_down_face: Wish you good luck ! REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> overfitting can be harmful. You can do a test/train as mentioned on piazza. I would probably say the people in top 10 that don't have 2000 submissions probably have better advice. :joy: My approach was mainly brute force. REPLY: <@UMCB313QT> I see you hiding at the bottom of the leaderboard.  You already have the best score possible, and you're just lulling everyone into a false sense of security until 11:55 PM tomorrow, right? REPLY: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: pushpit has a pretty good score. The competition is definitely going to be close. Truthfully, in the middle of testing numbers I stopped to focus on studying and I did not get around to putting my best numbers up yet. I'm pretty sure the numbers are going to change dramatically tomorrow. I would not be surprised if a bunch of people that are on the bottom shoot to the top. REPLY: Just to be honest the last 1200 submissions I did were a waste, and it not gain me anything. There is a few numbers on the board that I just can't beat. REPLY: I'd be happy with top 10. REPLY: Well, I'm #9 now, so that'll be my rank once you fix your score :laughing: REPLY: Maybe I'll have the same score as someone in the top leaderboard and then move everyone up by 1 :slightly_smiling_face: Seems risky though lol REPLY: ended up on 28th, I whish I could have dedicated more time to this. It was super fun to compete though. 
THREAD: How did everyone pass MP2.4? I tried all the methods. I can tune my BM25 on cranfield.dat above 0.365 (same as 1st ranker on leaderboard) and I submitted more than 150 times and my score is still zero. I wonder what else I can do. REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> - Yes, you are right. We can’t say it’s generalized to other two datasets (AP and Faculty) unless we submit. What Ray meant was you shouldn’t strive for 90% accuracy on Cranfield as it will not perform well(generalize) on “Unseen Data” (AP and Faculty). This activity is more of checking what combination of k1, b and k3 can perform better on all three datasets. REPLY: The max on Cranfield I saw was around 36% which also performed well on other two and beat the baseline. REPLY: Usually k1 and b are kind of standard given several prior experiments and works well in the range k1 between 1-2, b between 0 and 1 and k3 depending on the smoothing you want on Query length. I used k3&lt;5 to beat the baseline. Hope this helps.  <https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch|https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch> REPLY: @<https://app.slack.com/team/U01BDCQ3EMT|Dheeraj (you can call me D)> thanks . I will try that REPLY: <@UEZT8D0SU> <@U019BTMTVLJ> - Please do DM me if you still have any questions. REPLY: I would take the scores on the leaderboard with a grain of salt. It seems clear to me that many people are building their models for each dataset and are switching the model based on the dataset to get higher scores, which is pretty hilarious. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> how would one do that? just curious because you just submit the ranker to the grader REPLY: The load_ranker method takes the config file as an argument. It's just a matter of reading the config file and checking which dataset is being used to choose which ranker you load. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> - But, that’s gaming the system. Isn’t it? It’s not the intent of this exercise I suppose. REPLY: Yeah, exactly. That's why it's so funny to me. Each of the rankers used will be overfitting each dataset, which is exactly the opposite of the intended lesson. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: REPLY: :smile: Agreed :smile: REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN>, how you came to the conclusion that different methods are being used for different data set? Its quite possible that many of top scorers are trying new alogs for better scores :grinning: REPLY: Somehow I am not able to up score for Faculty whatever I do can reach max to *"*0.9239370430896358". Any suggestions apart from using different model for diffferent data set? REPLY: I guess that is technically possible. Fair point. I hope they will share the new ranking functions after the assignment deadline if that is the case.   As for your second question, I found the default bm25 k1 and b parameters were very close to the best I could find without overfitting. k3 definitely should be tweaked since the default value is way too high. Try making slight changes to b and k1 after you've found a good k3, and I mean very slight. That was the best I could do. REPLY: There's probably a better way to test fit than I could manage. I couldn't figure out how to get metapy to properly use my train and test data for some reason, and I don't have time anymore to figure out why. If you can manage that you may have better results.  Dheeraj was the one who helped me realize how much of a difference k3 makes. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thanks a lot. You are so knowledgeable and helpful. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> Thanks very much for your suggestions. But I am confused how can we tune k1,b,k3 for faculty data since that we don't have the faculty data set. Do we submit one, write down the score from livedatalab, then try another one? It is hard to web scraping livedatalab, because it is javascript dynamically loaded content. REPLY: <@U019BTMTVLJ> - You are most Welcome Jie. Just doing my bit.  To your other Q, we can’t tune for Faculty as this dataset is unseen data. The idea is to find the parameters which work well with “seen” data (on Cranfield) and check how the parameters are doing on “unseen” data (AP and Faculty). We need to find the “best fit” for all three and not just Cranfield which means if we fit Cranfield exceptionally, if may still fail AP and Faculty as they are different corpuses.  REPLY: If you're wondering how other people are optimizing for the faculty dataset, which I have a very strong suspicion they are, I think they're just tuning parameters and checking the results after each submission. Then they load a ranker with those parameters if the dataset specified in the config file is the faculty dataset. I'm not recommending that you do this, but it is a strategy that works even if it results in rankers that are overfitting their datasets, which is not something you want in a real-world application. REPLY: It seems the default BM25 parameter is the baseline to beat in order to get a full score. It is very unlikely that the default parameter is already the optimal given our data set. It must be the case that there's a direction to which you move a small enough step from the default parameters and get better result. A few times of trial will bring you there I guess

REPLY: Where to find the book - <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=37> REPLY: <@UF4MYF58Q> - Well, that book was written by Professor Cheng Zhai himself, so I guess its taken and granted that the material will be inspired from that book.  <@UMCB313QT> - 3 key resources I’m reading - Text book, Lecture Topics (Videos) and All Quizzes/Additional Material. Mine’s on 20th. Will keep you all posted on the experience and any inputs that I can provide. REPLY: I'm in 4 classes this semester. I actually love to listen to CS 410 Lectures. I would say that I really like how Dr. Zhai delivers it. I know that sometimes it is hard to focus on lectures when the professor might have an accent, but Dr. Zhai is very good.

THREAD: Guys I’m confused with the 2.4 the only thing we have to do is return metapy.index.OkapiiBM25(k1, k2, k3) with the right k values? Do we have to add something in the config.toml or not?  REPLY: I didn't change config.toml.  I'm certain you can pass the HW without touching it. REPLY: Ok so we just need to return the right K values depending of the dataset?  REPLY: Yes REPLY: Yep! REPLY: <@U0147TVTF5E> - That’s right Omar. No changes needed in config file to beat the baseline. Just change the load_ranker() function and add k1, b and k3 to the BM25()  It’s mostly guessing the best optimal parameters. You don’t need for loop as well as checking on other files. The grader will check your parameters against AP News and Faculty. You just need to train or evaluate on Cranfield data. All are set in the program, just play with the BM25 parameters REPLY: so nobody invented a new ranking algorithm as the MP suggested? :P REPLY: I may be close :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: 
THREAD: <@U01249Y9STH> - Interesting. Are you referring to cranfield queries themselves? Or the config? I believe none of the changes to config are considered while grading. It’s default to whatever they have given in first place. Is it essential to tweak with cranfield data itself to arrive at better scores? REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> - sorry for the confusion.  The function signature to implement is: ```def load_ranker(cfg_file):``` I meant that I made use of `cfg_file` when constructing the ranker. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Thank you for the personal message Michael. Appreciate it. Sure, I will think in that direction. For me, Its really become more of digging deeper and learning ALL about BM25 than leaderboard.  Appreciate all your inputs in CS410 class and always helping other students. Bravo :raised_hands::skin-tone-2:  REPLY: I do what I can :slightly_smiling_face:  Good luck! REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Micheal, if I may ask - have you tweaked the config.toml by any means? I heard students “training” on other datasets (AP and Faculty) but how’s this possible? We don’t have access to other datasets, isn’t it?  I changed Analyzers, Filters in config.toml based on MetaPy documentation but didn’t help much. In fact, it didn’t change anything. 
THREAD: Anyone here who got into Top10 of Leaderboard in MP2.4? Any pointers or specific hints to improve the model? Is there a need for custom implementations and latest frameworks or tuning k1, b and k3 suffices? Just curious to know. REPLY: I believe they call it Heuristics. I tried a few of the other frameworks and even the custom we implemented in the earlier MP. Tweaking the k1 and b got me high enough on the board to safely pass with 8 attempts (well, 8 pushes to github, since their datasets differ from the local one on results) and calling it good. 
THREAD: Hi guys, I have found a database of customer support interactions (from cust to company and back).  There are like 9 different companies there. Can you please suggest some ideas on what kinds of analysis I could do with it? I think it brings itself to sentiment analysis. But beyond that any suggestions? REPLY: Some of the usecases I could think of- • Effectiveness of support. • Fraud detection- If support representative charges proportional time (e.g. call centers ) of interactions. • Identify product enhancements opportunities from customer point of view.. • Identify opportunities to enhance support tools  or training customer support. • Sentiment analysis. • Wiki of problems search… you can leverage most this course techniques. REPLY: Predict likelihood of customer renewing their contract / subscription with the company. 
THREAD: ProctorU has a time toggle on the side asking you what time you want to take the test. I always end up missing it, and assume that the first displayed times are the only times for that date. I scheduled pretty far out :stuck_out_tongue:, and everytime was open REPLY: Thanks! I am on campus so still waiting to sign up :upside_down_face: REPLY: That's aggravating; I hope U of I resolves that soon. REPLY: <@U019KBWLYKG> - I believe ProctorU is now open for on-campus as well. Saw a post in Piazza from Bhavya day before yesterday I guess. REPLY: The post on Tuesday turned out to be a false alarm 
THREAD:  REPLY: I personally chose not to wait that long, if only because 3 weeks of new information (that won’t be on the test) will come and go by then. REPLY: I don't want to wait, but I have another midterm with a fixed date, so I value the flexibility. It's going to be odd having several weeks of not being able to discuss it.  :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: How is the midterm? Are there technical questions? REPLY: There were some calculation questions that were doable with mental math. The rest of them were theoretical questions which were a little tricky but fair imo REPLY: were they similar to the quizzes like they said? REPLY: Yeah they were REPLY: how many questions were for 2 hours? was the time enough? REPLY: I took this course in fall 19 and time was never a factor in the exams. Unless something has changed you should have more than enough time on your hands REPLY: Yeah it was 20 questions and there was enough time to go over the questions multiple times REPLY: Would studying the quizzes be the most productive way to study? REPLY: That and the study guide is what worked for me... The guide was really thorough and had all the important points. Better notes than I could ever hope to take :) REPLY: Awesome! Thank you 
THREAD: Hi, for MP 2.4 how do we arrive at the correct values? is it by trial method. I have been trying with the metapy.index.DirichletPrior(mu) and have made 18 submissions so far. The values are close to the baseline but the score is still 0. What method should I follow to tune the parameters? Will any ranker work for this or we need to use a specific one or write our own ranker. Any inputs? REPLY: I'm not sure if it's possible to link other messages but there's a good discussion about this above, on October 2nd. REPLY: When I was manually tuning, I was keeping a record of my numbers of every submission for all three datasets.. that was giving me an idea of which parameter to increase and which one to decrease..I ended up beating the baseline after 28th  trial. REPLY: I used BM25 . REPLY: Thanks <@UMJ1A4SSG> and <@U018ALZD5BN>. Let me try with BM25. So far I had been trying with DirichletPrior with no luck so far. REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> is this the conversation you're referring to? <https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/archives/C20U1T84T/p1601639176043800> REPLY: Yeah that's the one REPLY: Cool, if you hover over another conversation and click on the "More Actions" menu (three dots arranged like a vertical traffic light), there's a "Copy Link" option which will get you a link like the one I pasted above. REPLY: Awesome! Thanks for telling me how to do that haha REPLY: Sure thing! REPLY: BM25 rules :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I was able to solve it with BM25 in 2 attempts. I was just wasting my time with DirichletPrior :neutral_face: REPLY: <@U013A4LTPGF> - Use BM25 - that’s the most powerful of the bunch. That’s the way to beat the baseline. REPLY: I tried with all five algorithms they provided and I could only beat the baseline with BM25.  I'm starting to think the others were offered because there's some value in combining algorithms, but I haven't figured out how to yet. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - Yeah, true. I tried all given rankers and a custom built PL2 Ranker and still couldn’t beat BM25. It’s kind of addicting though. Going through research papers now to improve BM25 (not just parameters) but introducing additional coefficients or probabilities into the loop. Will keep this thread updated with further progress.   If anyone still trying to beat the baseline, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. REPLY: The best I could get to was Rank#33 in Leaderboard. Let’s see :crossed_fingers::skin-tone-2: REPLY: Calling it a day, could get to Rank#24. Will try BM25+ paper tomorrow. If anyone interested, I will post the details of the paper and my custom implementation. REPLY: Yes, I'm interested <@U01BDCQ3EMT>! Is the paper linked in the course? REPLY: <@U018ALZD5BN> - No, paper isn’t linked in the course. There are flavors of BM25 created with optimizations by different organizations and academic contributors. BM25+, BM25F etc. This one from Microsoft Research group.  REPLY: Ah cool I'll start digging REPLY: I’ll keep you posted on further progress and if there is any considerable improvement over my current scores. 
THREAD: Just curious: how many of you are going to do the project by yourself? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - I did a fun experiment to pick up my project team and well, I didn’t get any response from my selections. I haven’t formed my team yet and got few messages from co-students. I may end up doing alone. How about you?  REPLY: Here is what i did as a fun project/experiment REPLY: I haven't tried to either join an existing team or create one myself. It seems so random to just pick someone you don't know. Not like we were actually together on a campus and could get to know each other. In the summer I got lucky and had a partner who worked out very well (A+ in the course and felt the work was split pretty evenly). I haven't thought about what the project I would like to do is, and probably won't give it much thought until after Exam 1, but concerned I will discover that all the "good" partners are gone. :grinning: On the other hand, I'm only taking this one course and am not really too pressed for time, so extra work doing it alone should not be a problem. In some ways I wish the project was assigned rather than picking your own...I think that would make things clearer. REPLY: I will be doing it alone! REPLY: <@U01243RGW0J> - All the very BEST Dixon :+1::skin-tone-2: REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - Wow ! Congratulations for A+ on your other course. Yeah, so true. It’s bit hard to have everyone aligned and not knowing how much one can contribute is a hard challenge. I’ve got few students approach me after posting the fun experiment but now not sure how to go about it. I’ve worked on SOTA Models like NLP Transformers, BERT etc. and wanted to expand on that for final project. However, I am not very sure of others interests. Hard to gauge.  CS410 and CS498 are the first courses I got enrolled starting this Fall. Let’s see ! Hope we all be able to do our best in the final project. REPLY: I joined a team of 5 in my other course, IoT, and so far most of the team is dead weight. Not a lot of initiative, poor communication, and inconsistent check in. They are undergrads and I am an industry veteran, so maybe that is a factor. However, in summer semester, my teammates were also working pros and looking to do the bare minimum, finish up early, etc. Honestly, I feel the overhead of forming teams and working out these kinks of incompatibility do not add much to the learning process, other than how painful &amp; inefficient self-organizing teams can be remotely. REPLY: Ryan, that's my fear. Cynically, I think the reason teams are used in so many of these courses is not to aid learning, but to minimize the amount of grading that needs to be done. :grinning: REPLY: :grin: 
THREAD: Hi Everyone, CS410 is my first course with UIUC. As you are aware ProctorU Exam1 is approaching. Does anyone have suggestions on how to prepare for the exam and pick a date after preparation? REPLY: I'm posting some of my findings here. Hope this helps!  Topics to perapre discussed on this piazza thread <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=540>  Exam format and schedule is discussed here <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=207> REPLY: I'm just going to go through all of the lectures and then the quizzes REPLY: Since this course is action-packed, and the midterm exam opens up the same week we start the second half of the course, I scheduled my exam for tomorrow night. REPLY: I'm going through all of the lectures, the practice exams, and the study guide REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, I scheduled mine next week. Please let me know going though the lecture helped you or not after your exam. REPLY: <@U018NUVUR5F> <@U01249Y9STH> - I’m giving myself time to prepare fully up till now and then give the exam. I’ve scheduled for 10/20. I believe the Exam Topics should be best place to start. I won’t be surprised to see similar or exact questions that we did in Quizzes.  <@U01249Y9STH> - All the very BEST Michael. Do keep us posted on any inputs and direction. Wish you hit 100% REPLY: Thank you!  My exam is 1 hr 15 mins away; I'll report back when it's over.  There's so much content!  I hope I've absorbed enough of it all ... REPLY: All the best!!  REPLY: 90%.  The exam was way scarier in my head than it was on paper.  That said, I definitely didn’t know BM25/Okapi as well as I needed to. REPLY: Going through the old lectures, retaking the practice quizzes, and memorizing some of the formulas definitely did help.  However, I wouldn’t say the study guide is 100% accurate, because there were many examples of “make sure you know X” where X didn’t make it into the exam. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> - :clap::skin-tone-2: Congratulations. Thank you so much for the update and appreciate your inputs Michael. I will keep these points in mind.  REPLY: Thank you, and good luck! REPLY: congratulations Mike <@U01249Y9STH>.. Thank you for sharing your experience :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH> Congrats! Does the exam had theoretical questions more?   REPLY: A bit of both.  I ended up using the scratch paper for one of the questions. REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, congratulations! Thanks for sharing your opinion! It is definitely useful for preparation. 
THREAD: The one thing I learnt from my other class CS498 is how important is to have support from co-students. I am volunteering for any questions on the material, topics, assignments and anything related to CS410 course. I’ve finished upto Week 8 and MP3 and prepping up for Group Project.  Do mention <@U01BDCQ3EMT> me and ask me any question on CS410. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thank you much. I am really finding it hard to tune the parameters in MP 2.3.   I tried around 50 times but then my overall score is always less. Any pointers would help me REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Are you finetuning InL2 or BM25? REPLY: I am using BM25  REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - If you are comfortable with Python, I’d recommend grid search or recursive looping on parameters (k1, k2) and plot the scores to see where it is plateaued. Then find the best possible parameters from that bunch before it starts degrading.  REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Manual/Bruteforce method will take time as you mentioned you tried around 50 times. Approach it programmatically and most importantly recursively. REPLY: I have been using loop to increment values K1 and b but didn’t change k2. Kept k2 as 500. You mean matplotlib to plot graphs?  REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> awesome, thank you for volunteering to do this!  I have a question related to smoothing probabilistic models. In the below, it’s very intuitive for me to understand why this is the correct answer. However, there is an exercise later on where we take that example but use smoothing. In that example, it says that the correct answer uses the exact same value for P(Q|D1) even though we are now smoothing. How can this be? REPLY: <@U018P9RDQF9> - Sure, you can use matplotlib or seaborn or bokeh or plotly. Honestly, it’s over engineering and not necessary for this assignment. Reduce K2 and b between 2.75-5. IMHO, try crossing the baseline and then you can work for extra credit. You can change config file to include more pre-defined libraries in TensorFlow or Python to fine tune the same later. REPLY: <@U017V4T5TC7> - If I am understanding your Question correctly, why there is no effect of Smoothing on that example?  Smoothing of P(w1|D1) or P(Q|D1) will remain the same when the term frequency of w1 equals the P(w1,C) in the collection.   Can you point me to the exact example in the slide/quiz? REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Thank you for the response. That was where I was getting tripped up… once I worked through the equation more, I saw that it scales relative to the P(w1,C).  Also, I believe I should have been plugging the bottom equation into the normal P(w1,D)*P(w2,D)…. format instead of trying to use the upper equation. Do you know what the upper equation is for? REPLY: <@U017V4T5TC7> - The equation in the above pic is one of the various smoothing methods - essentially this smoothing method is to get the probability of seen versus unseen words in the document using collection language model.  This equation is specific to “Jelink-Mercer” method of smoothing (see below of function f indicating JM). This is a method with fixed coefficient which is lambda. Remember the assignments where we were asked to pick any ranking/scoring functions like BM25, JM etc.  In that example in lesson 4.6 - if we go by “Document” - the term “Network” will have 0 probability as this is not present in the document. Instead of Document, this smoothing takes into account “Collection Model” which will have a non-zero probability for unseen words like “Network” also.   Hope this answers your question. Let me know if you still have any questions. REPLY: If anyone still trying to beat the baseline for MP2.4, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. 
THREAD: Hello All :wave::skin-tone-2:  Hope you are having a fantastic weekend and busy with all "MP Assignments".  I am done with my assignments and prepping for Group Project.  I've deep interest towards State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models in NLP especially - Transformers, BERT (and all flavors) and GPT-3.  I'm planning to work on one of these areas as my project for CS410 - It would be EPIC and AWESOME !!  Let me know if you are one of the selected team members and willing to work with me as a team.  REPLY: Hi Dheeraj, I would like to join. REPLY: <@UAN3XUSCR> - If I may ask, do you have any prior experience working with any of the above topics? Transformers, SOTA NLP models like BERT, GPT-3? 
THREAD: Hi everyone,  For MP2.4, do we need to tune parameters randomly or do we have any other approach? Any inputs are appreciated  REPLY: I think manually tuning the parameters is the way to do it REPLY: That's what I did and passed on the first try...every attempt to tune after that so far has made it worse. :grinning: REPLY: How was MP2.4 compared to the rest of MP2?  Hardest part so far, or about the same? REPLY: So is it basically just luck and manual tuning? I optimized for cranfield but it’s no where close to passing because Faculty is weighted so high.  REPLY: As we cannot access test dataset, i tam thinking we can only guess test dataset (espeically Faculty dataset) feature REPLY: Thank you all.  <@URM1CGMR9>  I tried so far 56 times but I couldn’t clear. I am not sure. What’s the best ranking function for this exercise?   I used JM and tried most of the values for lambda between 0 and 1 but still I couldn’t get a score greater than overall baseline score  REPLY: I am in the same boat.  I have found the best BM25 combination optimized for cranfield but it’s still below the overall baseline.  How do we simulate the Faculty data set without the Faculty queries or relevance? Some people passed on the first try so we must be missing something.  REPLY: tried a grid search over the params on the cranfield data set and it didn't produce a passing result.  Opted for manual grid search through submissions and that did it.  Not sure what we are supposed to be learning through that approach though... Did use some intuition from the grid search to determine which params to fix and which to tune REPLY: <@UJ4UDD4Q7>  yes! I am clueless as what to do  REPLY: I followed Karlin’s method above and finally passed.  Thanks  REPLY: This is the worst assignment of all times... No learning just frustration ...The tuning would be easy if they would have provided us all the datasets.. REPLY: You bet <@UMJ1A4SSG>... it's more a test of patience than anything else! Sigh. I have been trying the approach you mentioned in the other thread and have crossed 28 tries so far, without being much closer when I started. Will probably save this for another day and use my time elsewhere... REPLY: <@UF21ZG5U6>, when you say "manual grid search through submissions", was that over the 'Leaderboard' page looking at the scores  for different data sets and what generated a passing '1'? REPLY: If anyone still trying to beat the baseline, use BM25. Pay special attention to k3 and keep the others default. Refer to the previous assignment - the parameters given for BM25 are optimal except k3. All the very BEST. REPLY: <@UMJ1A4SSG> - Well, if all datasets were provided, then all of us would’ve overfitted for the data. In real-world implementations the ultimate success or evaluation of any ML model is based on how it performs on “Unseen Data”. Agree that it’s painful to keep submitting and only knowing the score after submission. That’s where the catch is. If we truly understand how these parameters are fitting to “cranfield” data - it’s easy to extend the same to any unseen data.   Just my 2 cents. REPLY: <@U01BDCQ3EMT> Agreed!! But not everyone is familiar with ML model performance tuning...For some people this may be the very first course where they are dealing with ML... I think is they should have given us some methods/ideas/suggestions along with this assignment to play with at least... Or  showed us a practical via lecture video for any other ranker function not used in assignment to at least understand and relate with.... I mean for me personally, I did not build my custom ranker and was just using hit and trial method to beat the baseline...I would like to go back to it sometime and do it again just for my understanding.... REPLY: <@UMJ1A4SSG> - I am with you on “trial and error”. I do agree a reference would have been helpful. I guess its comes to down to patience to arrive at optimum value based on best guesses and multiple submissions. I myself did around 80 to get into Top20 and still trying to improve. I’m unsure if the intent of this activity is for us to “find our way” and read/research about IR rankers and methods etc.

THREAD: What’s a reasonable MAP for MP2.2 when implementing InL2? I saw something on Piazza where somebody said something like .16 is too low but mine is only like .24. REPLY: Mine is .2422. Also what are folks getting for a p-value? REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> i just got p = 0.03487 REPLY: I ended up with 0.0001619 REPLY: I got <tel:00000012153|0.0000012153> REPLY: nice REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - For InL2 MAP can be upto 0.30. I have a p-value of 5.813e-06 which is equivalent of 0.000005813 REPLY: That's really impressive... REPLY: <@URM1CGMR9> - Thank you Howard. I was experimenting with parameters (some_param and top_k) and did a kind of bruteforce on different parameters. I got pretty good results with top_k upto 100 and some_param upto 2.75 and then it degraded. However, the assignment goes through only if we have some_param = 1 and p-value &lt; 0.5.

THREAD: I think all-in-all it took me about 3 hours?  It's a relatively simple project but there are some hiccups to watch out for: 1. The code doesn't work on Python 3.7.  I was able to get it to work on Python 2.8, and others said they were successful on 3.5.  Details on <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=392> 2. The formulas in the README.md don't carry over when you clone the project.  You can look at the original README.md for reference, or view them in Piazza ( <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=429> ), or fix your README.md to add them ( <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=423_f1> ) 3. Not all of the aspects of the formula are clear; this post should help, if you need it: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=368>, and also this one: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=467> 4. For the final part, the README.md says to output results to two different text files and either (a) read them and process a calculation in R, or (b) read them in a new Python program and run the same calculation.  I ended up just running that calculation in the original search_eval.py, and documented how I did it here: <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=424_f2> REPLY: <@U01249Y9STH>, thanks a bunch for your considerate post, sharing your experience and consolidating the relevant links. This is going to be huge time-saver... more than an hour for me for sure. Appreciate that very much! REPLY: <@U018DNRNV1C> - you're very welcome, and good luck! REPLY: Michael, thanks a lot for the summary, I have a question about the formula, in case if yours passed all the tests: in the beginning of 1-st formula there is a sum of counts (term, query). Am I correct that in the function instead of that all what we have is just one count(term, query), and rest of the formula is unchanged? I'm asking, as I have got in the grader the result FEEDBACK: InL2 not implemented correctly!!! FEEDBACK: significance.txt not found or does not contain a valid float value!!!, so I'm trying to understand whether I really inserted formula incorrectly, or there can be some other root cause. And 2-nd question: is your answer on significance looks like X.XXXe-07? This is the format which my R outputs, so I wonder if this can also generate the issue. REPLY: <@U012LLB5SHJ> - that's a good question!  The `score_one` method literally means that it will calculate the score for ONE term, which means the ranker itself will walk over every term in the query + document union and call the `score_one` function, then sum all of the results for you.  Your focus is just to implement the red part, and the framework will handle the rest: REPLY: The significance.txt for me is a number that is formatted in the way that you described, but there is literally nothing else in the file, not even a new line. REPLY: Yes, I did same, but still it report failure. Did you use default parameters or chosen the optimal ones for bm25 as some Piazza post suggesting? Probably, I will try to check with TA on tomorrow office hours, what is the issue, as I think that it is somewhere in parameters probably. I tried to set some parameters to have MAP less than 0.227 on bm25 and left c=1 on my function, but it still did not help. For me it is not clear from the task definition, which parameters to chose for comparison REPLY: hi <@U01249Y9STH> or anyone else, since we're kind of jumping around python versions, what tools/software are you using to readily switch and to run it? anaconda? REPLY: For point number 1. I run the MP2.2 using Python 3.7 on Windows without any issue. REPLY: I found the issue in my function: log function was wrong(did math.log(x) instead of math.log(x,2), just picked up the function description from the wrong source initially, realized just today, with this post. <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=500>. Still, my X.XXXe-07 value is not accepted. Not sure if this is the issue of the format, or some parameters of the rankers need to be tuned. REPLY: <@U0181TGSQH0> - I’m using a Mac and I use brew for most things, and a lot of these dependencies are just magic to me.  On my machine, `python` is Python 2.7, `python3` is Python 3.7, `pip` is for Python 3.x, and `pip2.7` is for Python 2.7.  It’s a mess; hopefully we’ll get away from metapy soon and on towards libraries that are supported by the latest &amp; greatest!

THREAD: I know there's a 50% late penalty for the MPs, but is there a similar penalty for the weekly quizzes? REPLY: I believe the first 6 quizzes are due half way through and last 6 at the end.

Thank you for reaching out :grin: REPLY: I'm open to using any sort of online messaging app though (facebook messenger, WhatsApp, GroupMe, etc.) REPLY: Yeah we can create a group  REPLY: Do you mind using messenger on facebook or groupme? REPLY: Yeah I can use Facebook  
THREAD: I mean the names of the staff?  REPLY: Are you referring to bio_urls.txt or bios.txt? REPLY: bios.txt is supposed to contain all sorts of information per each faculty member (i.e. Name, Contact Info, Education, etc.) and bio_urls.txt is supposed to contain the link that redirects you to the individual faculty pages. REPLY: Bio_urls.txt REPLY: Sorry bios.txt REPLY: bios.txt should have all of the info next to the faculty names, without the urls. Which is what <@U019ND33ZDY> said REPLY: bios.txt just needs one scraped text for a corresponding bio_urls.txt’s url. in my case I scraped just the expertise of the faculty and submitted (about probably 40-50 chars per line) . I got passed on the MP. REPLY: Yeah I passed it too Thanks for your help guys  
THREAD: For MP2.2, do we need to create individual txt files with average precision value for each query or just the mean average precision?  REPLY: It wants the individual AP's.  You'll need them in that form to do a t-test. REPLY: <@UCC3KEKU7> so, the file should contain multiple lines and each line corresponds to AP for each query right?  Also, I do get error when I try to do a t-test using scipy.stats  REPLY: Do we need to do any conversion when we read AP from files?  REPLY: That's what worked for me.  One per line. I used the R code, so I can't speak to how scipy.stats works.  The files were ready as-is for R. REPLY: Oh got you  REPLY: Thank you much  
THREAD: Guys do we have to use the web driver? Bc in the instruction does not say that we have to load that program, also I don’t find the driver for my current version of chrome  REPLY: what version of chrome are you using? REPLY: I didn't use it. I'm not even sure why they chose that approach...seems more complicated than simply using requests.get REPLY: I believe you need the webdriver for pages that render using javascript REPLY: good point...the website i chose didn't do that 
THREAD: MP2.1, does anyone know if the faculty page has individual URL's that are all different, can we manually save the bios? they are all custom webpages and would require a script for each individual person. REPLY: You'd have to ask an instructor, but I would think that kind of violates the spirit of the MP. Perhaps you should find a different school/department? REPLY: Yea, definitely not trying to skirt around anything. I wonder if others ran into the same issue and had to switch schools? REPLY: Clarification, i used beautifulsoup to scrape the URLs. So the code works for that, its just the bios links to URLs off the webpages to personal pages. REPLY: Yeah if what you're saying is that all the professors have custom webpages with different layouts, I would probably try to find a different college to work with REPLY: Roger, i changed school pages. thanks for the input <@URM1CGMR9> and <@U0187FAMNMR> REPLY: Cool, I think you'll thank yourself in the long run 
THREAD: for MP 2.1 how to access the signup sheet? It says use your Illinois email but the sheet is a google doc and not accepting the email REPLY: Refer to piazza post 211 REPLY: cool. That helped :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: You're welcome :blush:  
THREAD: I’m a bit behind and trying to plan my week... how involved is MP 2.1? Is it fairly straightforward or pretty difficult? REPLY: Its straight forward... sample code provided is 90% of coding done REPLY: Thank you! REPLY: Even if you forgot about the sample code and wrote all of it like I did, it's short and straightforward haha REPLY: Depends on the structure of the faculty web page you pick to some degree. Mine was very semantically structured HTML (no JS), so I did not have to write much custom scraping code to find the relevant elements. REPLY: It is straight forward. Took me less than 2hrs including setup 
THREAD: Is mp 2.3 out yet? REPLY: No it probably won't be until 2.1's due date as it uses the data from thart REPLY: that 
THREAD: For MP2.2, kindly clarify what c(t,D) means and how to implement it? REPLY: Count of the term t in document D. This is standard notation that the professor uses in week 4 lessons, check them before going for the HW (if you have not done so already).  REPLY: Thanks, oops completed MP2.2 already without week 4 lectures  :grinning: 
THREAD: I'm a little confused with the sign-up sheet. Can we pick a school in sign-up sheet or we have to find a school ourselves and enter them in the sign-up sheet? REPLY: Just ensure combination of school and dept that you choose doesn’t already exist in the sheet. At max there can be 5 duplicates. Once you know what combo you are going for, mention that in the sheet as in a new row.  REPLY: thank you that's helpful! 
THREAD: Has anyone done MP2.2? If so, what average precision do you get from InL2Ranker(c=1)? I got 0.2093382961003333 and autograder said my ranker was incorrect. I have no clue how to debug this... <https://piazza.com/class/kdp8arjgvyj67l?cid=351> REPLY: Double check your implementation of the formula in the score function REPLY:  It seems the autograder is not looking for the value but is looking for the implementation and then I think it is checking the p value

THREAD: Guys I’m confused in the MP1 the MeTA Toolkits is in the terminal?  REPLY: Ya you do it in the terminal!  REPLY: Yes <@U0147TVTF5E>, you must excute them on teminal. These command are useful when you do the actual assignment. The actual assignment is to write the code in example.py file.

I have not very extensive programming experience, as I was working as a PM all the past years, but so far all what was required to do I could follow so should be no issues. I'm very inspired by the studied topic and the possibility to do something as close to reality as possible so would be interested to pair. What timezone are you? I'm in PST. REPLY: I am interested joining your group. About me, I have 12+ years of programming experience in Java and can manage GoLang and Python decent enough. I have not worked much in big data and text retrieval space before, I am excited to work on this subject as it open more job opportunities in future. I am in PST time zone. How about you? REPLY: Hi Marina and Savita, sorry I’ve found 2 classmates for the project. They DM’ed me. REPLY: No worries, thanks for informing :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Hi Marina &amp; Savita - I am in the LA area and am also looking to form a team. I have fairly good knowledge on Cloud concepts, AWS, Serverless implementation, Microsoft tools and programming stack and Database technologies. If you both are still available, we can form a team then. Cheers !

THREAD: LF: Study material to go through before CS410 class starts..Any pointers? REPLY: I've not taken CS410 yet, but the MOOCs are available in Coursera: Text Retrieval and Search Engines and Text Mining and Analytics

THREAD: Hi, I'm planning on taking CS-410 in the Fall.  I'm trying to get a head start on the MOOC version of it now so I can take a second course that semester. It looks like the weeks match up, content-wise, except for the project at the end.  *Can anyone comment on how smoothly the 1) quizzes and 2) homeworks transfer over to the MCS-DS version of the course?  Are the lectures the same?* I note that the MOOC called _Text Retreval and Search Engines_ has two optional "Honors" programming assignments.  It looks like the first one is "build a search engine" using MeTA.  The second is a search engine competition.  Do these line up with the MCS-DS version's homeworks? REPLY: Search engine competition is present, however dataset etc will change. Much better to focus on the quizzes and get them transferred. lectures were the same for the first part in 2019; not sure if it changes in 2020. REPLY: Thanks... So were the lectures in the second part (weeks 7-12) the same too? REPLY: i think they were the same in 2019 REPLY: do all the quizzes transfer over? and what about the homework? REPLY: homework changes every time i guess; For e.g one of the homework i remember was extracting data from public pages..say prof bios..removing stopwords etc and then submitting it to create a dataset..and then using it to tweak search parameters used in creating the matrix..so these wont transfer as the code is autograded (Univ gitlab used) and these were different from the MOOC. For quizzes, they did; I had completed 1-2 weeks and they transferred over. REPLY: Hi <@UCC3KEKU7>, are you doing the paid version of the mooc here: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-retrieval>, or is this available separately freely for Illinois students (IIRC at Coursera@Illinois, though I am unable to find its link) REPLY: It's Coursera for Illinois.  Free as long as you're enrolled in MCS. <https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-for-illinois-gp2ja?authProvider=illinois> REPLY: nice. thanks - will give it a shot.

THREAD: I ordered my grade on the website.  However it shows the following status "Your transcript is being held at your request". I'm wondering when will they release the hold and sent the transcript? Or is that safe to click remove hold button? REPLY: You can very well manage that while placing the order. Looks like you have selected to hold the transcript until the final grades are posted. Though we can see the final grade in the system not sure why that option is still showing while placing the order. You can either remove hold to get the pdf downloaded version or cancel the existing order and place the order without hold. REPLY: Remove Hold on your order. There is a button on the order review screen REPLY: Ok thanks guys. I clicked the button to remove the hold. REPLY: I think it will take ~24 hours to deliver pdf REPLY: Immediately it won't come REPLY: Grades aren't "final" until the 10th I believe 
THREAD: My MP4 weight also not showing up on Coursera but CS 410 grades already published on University portal.... not sure if they added MP4 marks in final grade. REPLY: Drop an email to Support group REPLY: I don't see MP4 grade in Coursera either; however, given my final grade, I'm positive it was factored in.  With that said, I know that a few people had said they saw a grade for MP4 in Coursera so not sure why it would be inconsistent. 
THREAD: The challenge is with the Spill to 2020 the tuition reimbursement will be considered in this financial year and thus impact lots of folks applying for same, as I believe lots of companies have upper limit of reimbursement. REPLY: Like in my case where my company only reimburse $7500 Max in an year, definitely it's going to be a problem bcoz fall 2019 reimbursement will be considered in 2020 reimbursment limit, so once I reach to Max limit I won't get approval in system for reimbursment for 3rd spring2020 course in this year REPLY: Same here. REPLY: Upper limit of $7500 REPLY: My case is much worse. My company has an upper limit of $5500 in a year. Every year's fall reimbursement will be spillover to next year. 
THREAD: I got my final grade. However, no certification generated in Coursera yet. Did you get yours? REPLY: Yes, I went to Coursera support and discussed over chat. They mentioned there is some issue in releasing certificate in Coursera for this course and their engineers are working day and night to fix it :upside_down_face:,so he manually released my certificate and I received it, you can do same as well REPLY: Ok, thank you for the information. REPLY: I don't have one for CS425 either... is it an issue with ALL Illinois classes? 
THREAD: For the truly impatient...  Here's a python script that will calculate your final grade.  Highlight the entire table from your browser and save it to a text file called "grades.csv".  You should end up with one table cell per line.  ```import pandas as pd import numpy as np import bisect  d = pd.read_csv('grades.csv',header=None)  l = list(d[0])  l.insert(3,'Time') l.insert(1,'Desc')  a = np.array(l).reshape(29,7) d2 = pd.DataFrame(a[1:],columns=a[0])  d2.Weight = d2.Weight.str.rstrip('%').astype('float') / 100.0 d2.Grade  = d2.Grade.str.rstrip('%').astype('float') / 100.0  # Drop the lowest two quiz scores  quiz_idx = d2.Item.str.match('Week \d+ Quiz') d2.loc[quiz_idx,'Weight'] = 0.025 drop_idx = d2.loc[quiz_idx].Grade.nsmallest(2).index d2.loc[drop_idx,'Weight'] = 0  # Extra Credit from MP4 # Guessing what they did to create the score in Coursera...  d2.loc[d2.Item == 'MP4 Grades','Weight'] = 0.03  score = (d2.Weight * d2.Grade).sum()  grades=pd.DataFrame({         'Score':[95,90,85,80,75,70,60,55,0],         'Grade':['A+','A','A-','B+','B', 'B-', 'C', 'D', 'F'] }).sort_values('Score').reset_index(drop=True)  print(f"""Final Grade: {         score*100:0.2f\ }% ({         grades.loc[bisect.bisect_right(grades.Score,score*100)-1,'Grade'] })""")``` REPLY: Did I mention <https://www.coursera.org/accomplishments>? REPLY: Yes.  That gives you the COURSERA score.  Most of us are rather interested in the UofI grade. REPLY: yep, just noticed that you are dropping lowest 2 quizzes grades REPLY: I cant see my coursera score in this page REPLY: I was able to, but if you can't you have 2 other options to calculate it. This python script and my javascript code (shared in previous message today) REPLY: When I go to accomplishments, 410 doesn't show up, class is still listed as In-Progress and MP4 shows up as Overdue....  I pinged them about the MP4 grade since it sounds like many people are seeing grades there. REPLY: I have no idea whether it is required... but I submitted that MP4 thing to get rid of the Overdue status. REPLY: I believe it is due to mp4, there are a few students with the same problem on piazza, I did an empty submission but the overdue status is still there REPLY: Sigh... well hopefully they'll clean it all up within a couple of days. REPLY: I contacted coursera and the certificate showed up in my account minutes later 
THREAD: looks like the weights for the quizzes is wrong REPLY: I gave the corrected code in the thread 
THREAD: Are we getting our final grade tomorrow in Student portal? REPLY: actually that’s the due date, I think they said the student portal would have the grades the following date REPLY: Yes… but without the final grade, nothing official. 
THREAD: though that wouldn’t include extra credit REPLY: True, but gives an idea about the final grade. 
THREAD: Now that all grades are posted in Coursera, I couldn't find a place for final grade for the course there. This javascript calculates that: ```var final = 0.0; document.querySelectorAll('.rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow').forEach(function(row, i){   var weight = parseFloat(row.querySelector('.weight-column').textContent) || 0;   var grade = parseFloat(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent) || 0;   var calculated = grade * (weight/100);   final += calculated; }); alert('Final grade is: ' + final + '%');``` You can run it in the console or type `javascript: &lt;code&gt;` in the address bar and hit return. (Note: when you paste the code in address bar, some browsers strip `javascript:` and you'd have to manually type it again after pasting. ```javascript:var final=0;document.querySelectorAll(".rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow").forEach(function(e,t){var n=parseFloat(e.querySelector(".weight-column").textContent)||0,r=parseFloat(e.querySelector(".grade-column").textContent)||0;final+=r*(n/100)}),alert("Final grade is: "+final+"%");``` You could also save this as bookmark in your browser REPLY: If you didn't do MP4 you will get `NaN%`  Here is a fix:  ```var final = 0.0; document.querySelectorAll('.rc-UngroupedNonPeerAssignmentRow').forEach(function(row, i){   var weight = parseInt(row.querySelector('.weight-column').textContent, 10);   var grade = parseInt(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent, 10);     if(weight === 0) return;   var calculated = grade * (weight/100);   final += calculated; }); alert('Final grade is: ' + final + '%');``` REPLY: ah I forgot `|| 0;`  in my grade/weight assignments ```var grade = parseInt(row.querySelector('.grade-column').textContent, 10) || 0;``` REPLY: Probably the better fix REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: no problem. Thanks for pointing out the issue and fixing :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: edited the original message REPLY: NOTE - For Chrome, putting this in the address bar did not work for me.  (redirected me to Google search...)  Worked fine from Console though.  Short Cut to Console [Windows] - CTRL-Shift-J  [Mac] - Not 100% sure, but "GoogleFu" indicates it is Command-Option-J REPLY: As I mentioned Chrome does strip the `javascript:` when you paste it, you just have to type it manually again after you paste REPLY: <@UMBMJ3B9N> I'm on Chrome and it worked using Sam's tip above... REPLY: You need to use parseFloat instead of parseInt , as MP2 grades are 2.5% each .  Use this corrected code. Otherwise the grades are little off by 2% REPLY: Awesome, makes my grade better :smile: REPLY: <@UM6RXU41J> - Good catch and when I run that version, grade matches what I calculated previously.  This looks good REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> - Maybe its my PC then?  Code works so all is good either way. REPLY: yep. Good catch <@UM6RXU41J> REPLY: updated :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: So, it turns out there is a place for final grade on Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/accomplishments>

THREAD: has anyone received completed status on coursera? usually when you finish the course or is close to it but have enough grades the course will be marked as complete and the certificate will be available. For me, this has not happened yet on this particular one.... REPLY: Yes, I have received the certificate from coursera when I completed my final exam. REPLY: Looks like I had a missing item, the reading in Week 15 (which basically says that this week has no content) was not maked as done, after that the course shows as complete, no certificate yet but may take a day to generate it.

THREAD: Is it a requirement to upload the source code to a public repo? REPLY: I think so. Otherwise how could instructors or TAs access to the private repo?

THREAD: Any one received Coursera certificate after exam 2? Usually Coursera send out a certificate with grade based on its own logic but this time I didn't get any email. REPLY: I did not receive for exam 1 either. REPLY: This is what I think : For STAT-420, while the TA/Professor setup the course and grades, they might have setup a minimum % to pass. The data analysis project was 20%. Say, if some had 75% already and the course minimum is 70% to obtain the completion certificate, one will receive the certificate immediately after the exam. But CS 410 may have higher minimum % or its not possible to get that minimum until the TAs update grades for final project. REPLY: I did receive the certificate immediately after exam 2.

THREAD: I guess the way ranker.score implemented somehow conflicts with flask REPLY: Thank you!  I think we're going to use vue, but with flask.. so maybe we'll need to try something different. REPLY: I am not an expert on these. This was the first time I used, but learned a lot while thinking that I was doing something wrong :joy: REPLY: Were you running the app locally using flask's integrated server? i.e. flask run . I've been googling and it sounds like maybe it's the integrated server that's an issue..but running on other servers is not.  Maybe once it's deployed to remote server it will work ?  We'll see..   You're right.. I'm learning a lot while troubleshooting, but I'm ready for it to work now :wink: REPLY: I saw that message too. I was running locally so never tried deploying it. I guess you should try and see. I was not sure if my app was fully functional or not. Now I know it works, maybe I will try with flask again. REPLY: I'm still trying to figure out how to run it locally using xampp or something else..  :wink: REPLY: In case anyone else runs into this same issue -- It was actually an easy fix that still took me a long time to figure out because all the specific examples I found seemed fairly complicated and complex...     I was able to use gunicorn to serve it up instead of the flask integrated server.. and it worked.  It was as easy as `pip install gunicorn` .   then `gunicorn app:app` at the command line (i.e. gunicorn [filename]:app) .

THREAD: Hey, Do you folks know if we get any discount or access to deeplearning VMs like Azure DSVM or Google's Deep Learning VM? REPLY: Yes. You get credits with your school account. We are using them. REPLY: Specifically for Azure. Info is online REPLY: Thanks Alan. Its 100$ credit right? Unfortunately 100$ lasted only for few days for a VM with GPU. REPLY: Yes, you need to shut it down. There are options to have it shut down automatically. It costs about $450 / month to run a standard VM continuously. REPLY: There are other options for deployment using platform as a service as well which will be cheaper. Not sure what you are using your VM for. REPLY: If you are doing ML, then consider using the Azure ML service. You should be able to run experiments well within the $100/month. REPLY: Awesome. Thank you. I used DSVM before so was checking about that (As I need Tensorflow and PyTorch support). Will explore Azure ML REPLY: Yes, I believe both are supported with Azure ML

THREAD: <@UM5B71WMA>  Me too! glad i’m not alone.  I’m trying to decide what parts are just “lost causes” for the short term and what I should focus on instead.  But i’m getting burnt and wondering if i should just take what I can now without throwing more time into it.  I still have project work to get through.... I learned a lot, but some of the lectures and slides....  wow... REPLY: What helps me is I just ignore the crazy formulas and rewrite the formula into what it is trying to accomplish so that I get the concept first and then drill into each piece's underlying math.  In some of the lectures he does a decent job of verbalizing what is happening, but the slide is just a bunch of crazy looking formulas which makes it harder to review later if you didn't make good note.  Judging from the mid-term and what he has said about the class, it seems if you understand what the formula is trying to do at a high level, you are A-OK. 
THREAD: do you get a grade though? REPLY: Yes but I’m the mid term I saw the questions I missed. Not this time :( REPLY: the good news is that, the final isn’t so heavily waited. So as long as you didn’t get a zero, you can still get an A in this class. i think with the extra credits, even with a zero, you can get an A. REPLY: I just wanted to see what I got wrong 
THREAD: but i didn't see that in the final i have no clue which ones i missed REPLY: How was it? Is it from weekly quizzes? REPLY: Def easier than the mid term REPLY: More quiz-like questions on the final. 
THREAD: Soliciting Opinions:  Work for Google or Start own company, which is better?...asking for a friend :face_with_rolling_eyes: REPLY: It depends :slightly_smiling_face: Personally, I am a Googler, and I'm happy with where I'm at, but if I were younger and didn't have family/kids to provide for I would be willing to take risks and start my own company. REPLY: Your friend should start the company and join Google! then decide what to continue with, they will learn a lot from both experiences. REPLY: Yes, indeed family as a big part of the decision. REPLY: I feel like those are the two extremes of risk level in the tech world (Google being the lowest risk and starting own company being the highest) :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: The risks are diametric thats for sure. REPLY: I would work for Google first for at least a couple years. Then start own company. REPLY: Follow your heart :heart:. If you have a good idea want to pursue, don’t wait!!! You could be the next Google. If you have an offer from big companies like Google, then it’s always good to have experience to work with such great companies. REPLY: However most of us don’t have this problem (decision between Google and Build your own startup) to worry about. :face_palm: REPLY: Jack Ma????? REPLY: If time is on your friend's side ( not much responsibilities/young in age etc)  I would say go for the company. If you are hired by google now you can definitely crack google or similar companies latter in your life as well. REPLY: Following the heart is definitely  an motivating factor! REPLY: The scary thing about accepting the google offer is settling in and becoming complacent, no ? REPLY: When I see people like Alexandr Wang, a 22 year old that started Scale AI...Left MIT as a first year student; up and left MIT! 
THREAD: not quizzes, just a review doc REPLY: where can I find it REPLY: think a TA posted it on Piazza 
THREAD: hey folks, did anyone see any grading criteria for the final project / presentation? REPLY: For a quick reference.  Team formation (5%)  Project proposal (10%)  Software code submission with documentation (65%): &gt;  The documentation should cover both how to use the software and how the software is implemented. &gt;   45% for source code submission; 20% for documentation submission. Both would be graded based on completion, and should be submitted through GitLab. Software usage tutorial presentation (20%) 
THREAD: Anybody taking that   Internet of things (IoT)  class? Is that going to be using C/C++ for the device programming? REPLY: Current on campus class looks like python 
THREAD: for MP4, did anyone face "{'submission_success': False, 'error': 'test: Timeout error: 500s'}" REPLY: i didn’t REPLY: I did… it happens if your program is taking long time to finish… I guess more than 500 Seconds. 
THREAD: just finished the final REPLY: how was it ? same as midterms in terms of difficulty ? REPLY: i thought it was slightly easier. all right out of the material (felt like the midterm had like 2 questions that required deducing the answer based on your knowledge) REPLY: Does the study guide cover what we need to know/ REPLY: Yep. I reviewed all the slides and quizzes along with that guide and felt that was good prep REPLY: Probably going to get it out of the way asap then, while I'm still fresh from the quizzes REPLY: Very smart plan :+1: REPLY: what! REPLY: man i’m jealous! REPLY: congrats Jeff! REPLY: needed to do it now, with this final project and the 2 PSL projects… REPLY: you’re a beast. good luck with PSL REPLY: thanks! i’ll be totally done with the program once i finish, so i figured worth it to push through! 
THREAD: I like the cyber truck, soooo ... REPLY: I pre-ordered one, nothing to lose for 100$ that's fully refundable. REPLY: same. i’ve always wanted a wrangler, so this would be that vehicle. REPLY: would be cooler if we could take doors and roof off REPLY: That demo didn't go well as Elon musk would have expected :smile: REPLY: He's got over 200k pre-orders so must have gone pretty well REPLY: 250k now REPLY: I think by the time Tesla fulfilled those pre-orders, I could get a used cybertruck on the market. :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: Speaking of taking 2 courses, Stanford's NLP course (which is all free except obviously you can't get your work graded or a credential for it) looks SO COOL and so complementary to this course (more recent applications, lots of deep learning, builds well on top of the foundation we get here). But where would I find the time to do it :books::books: <http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/> REPLY: I did my Tech Review on that :) REPLY: Such a cool tool. I think its the best in NLP business. REPLY: Yeah, thinking more and more about this certificate... <https://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&amp;certificateId=1226717>  Though I really just want it for the skills themselves. Allie, you said their material is free? REPLY: <@UMAK9MLAC> yeah, I think it depends on the class but 224n and a lot of other classes have all the lecture slides, assignments (can't get a grade), and some videos posted for free online 
THREAD: I submitted for our team and have no feedback as of yet REPLY: Did you get a grade but no feedback or neither? REPLY: Finally got it this evening - both the grade and feedback were missing until then  
THREAD: Comment for me was hard to find. Go to grades page and there was a status icon, when hover over it I can see couple sentences of comments. very basic feedback REPLY: I found my comment by going to week 7 on coursera, opening the "project proposal submission" and clicking the "view feedback" next to grade...  For reference, my only feedback was: "What does your timeline look like?" REPLY: I guess mine doesn't have any feedback then. 
THREAD: Has anyone in here also taken Intro to Data Mining (CS 412)? If so, how do they compare? REPLY: 412 was a better course IMO.  I believe there were 6 MPs and 2 exams.  2-sided cheat sheet for exams.  MPs were programmed from scratch and no libraries,  It has its challenging parts to be sure, but no BS paper or project, and it was organized.  Really good TAs.  It was my first course in the program so it was a tidal wave of new information and learning to program in Python.  Missed an A- by .5 pts.  Quality lectures, and no 31 minute videos.   Oh, and he uses good examples so you’re not left figuring out something as abstract as PLSA from a complex math problem.   To be fair, I’ve learned a lot from both courses.  REPLY: what do you mean 2-sided cheat sheet? REPLY: You can use both sides of a 8.5 x 11" paper to put notes on for your exams.  TBH, it wasn't as helpful as it sounds since the exams were largely conceptual rather than applying formulas.  I believe you could also take the weekly quizzes an unlimited amount of times, not just the practice quizzes. REPLY: Cool. Comparable work level? REPLY: At times I felt like this class is more work, but it's probably comparable and just spaced out differently. REPLY: was that the 412 exam or 410? I thought you couldn't have any notes for the 410? REPLY: When I took 412 this spring you could have the cheat sheet, and a restroom break, during the two exams. REPLY: CS412 is a great course and I would highly recommend it. Personally I found Prof. Zhai's lectures in CS410 to be a lot better than the one by Prof. Han's in CS412. While going through CS412 lectures, I always felt like something was missing and had to refer the book to complete my understanding. That's probably the only issue I had with CS412. 
THREAD: Who is also taking this class as their first class in MCSDS? What are you taking as your next class? REPLY: Am taking CCA REPLY: this is my first. i'm registered to CS498 Cloud Computing Applications next REPLY: this was my first class. ABM next REPLY: CCA- Get ready for Hadoop map-reduce, and spark map-reduce , apachi Storm , redis,  cassandra and lots more stuff types of Database in memory mainly-- Lots of programming assigmnets in Java or python pick your poison ! Good luck REPLY: sounds like fun! REPLY: Awesome! I think I will be taking that class as well. CCA. REPLY: ...and oh yeah you have to do your report in IEEE format... So get familiar with that if you are not already. REPLY: This is my first semester (410 / 425 value pak!) Taking 445 next REPLY: CCA sounds like interesting stuff, though. REPLY: Which one is 445? REPLY: I am taking this class together with Cloud Networking for my first semester. I plan to take computational photographic next. REPLY: <@UMW0NBSDT> Computational Photography REPLY: Maybe is fun, I don't know if I want to deal with these problems tho REPLY: You also get AWS  basic assignments. deploying instanses /clusters adding load balancers  parallel computing batch processing.

Going to take CCA and Computational Photography in next one 
THREAD: Pradeep - I didn't go through the first study guide in great detail, but it seemed like study guide touched all of the main areas.  More detail than on the coursera test for sure.  The Exam 2 study guide is pretty big and had something like ~50 different key points, some of which had lengthy explanations.  Pretty sure the Exam 2 on Coursera is another 20 questions.  I think it will cover everything on the test; however, not sure you'll have a clue where the 20 questions will come from.  (assume PLSA, CPLSA, though, etc.)  I Did "OK" on Exam 1, but I generally suck on multiple choice questions so these are sub-optimal for me. REPLY: Where did you find the exam 2 study guide? REPLY: yeah where did you find the study guide? i don't see it on Coursera REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=966> 
THREAD: The person I _want_ to be would take it before Dec. 7th, but the person I actually am needs to take it right before the due date :sweat_smile: REPLY: This time I started telling myself "I am not going to leave it til last minute" early on, so that's an improvement. (this doesn't affect the fact that I will take it last minute) 
THREAD: I need a few more days for the tech review. On Piazza, one of the TAs said "Just please let us know that you will be submitting your work later [...] a private post on Piazza will suffice." How do I send a private post on Piazza? Any ideas? Thanks. REPLY: Oh, I suppose it just means I send it to all the Instructors. 
THREAD: They're the same... REPLY: Ok.  Why would they be the same? REPLY: Because the probability of not finding "photon" is 1-.01 = 0.99 which is the same as the probability of finding "the" 
THREAD: Part 2 of this course is really hard to grasp and remember things, don't know how would I be able to remember things for exam 2. Do we need to get any passing score in exam? REPLY: I have hard time understanding too, have been going through videos again and again in repetition REPLY: yeah have to watch these a couple of times and more important, make a Legend for what all of the special characters stand for as well as key formula components.  I try to re-write all of the formulas in english and walk through a simple sample to help understand.  It doesn't help when some of the letters used previously are re-hashed here for a different meaning. 
THREAD: only criteria i saw was 600 words REPLY: where was the 600 words criteria posted? I must have missed that REPLY: I saw that too..somewhere on Piazza I think... REPLY: Yea, comments over here mention ~2 pages:<https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=896> And then comments here say minimum 600 words: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=389> REPLY: My group noticed that in the grades section, the technology review was listed as 10% of the grade, but that seemed inconsistent with something else I had read.  But then again, inconsistency has been pretty rampant. REPLY: I read somewhere that tech review will not have any credit score REPLY: ^ Credit is only for doing it and not for the quality of the writing etc.. REPLY: Stanford Zhou 5 days ago There's no hard limit, but around 2 pages is expected. 
THREAD: How formal are people generally getting with their tech reviews? The two examples shown are of wildly varying quality, depth, formality and formatting. Also not sure if I should be writing out references in an academic or informal style. REPLY: I formatted my references in formal 'academic' style, but the paper itself was less formal.  Mine was probably somewhere between the two examples.  I definitely put time into writing it, but most of the effort was put into learning about the tool and trying it out for myself.  I  didn't try to "rework" it as much as I would have if I knew we were being graded on the actual writing rather than just completion. To be honest, I would be surprised if they even have the time to read them. REPLY: For only two pages of content I kept it relatively shallow on the tool technicalities and spent most of the paper describing new situations that could benefit from the tool. REPLY: I did not go crazy on the formatting of references as one of the samples provided on Coursera hardly used a formal format.  Just did standard Title, Author, Date, URL/Doc pointer in a consistent format for all of them. 
THREAD: Thoughts on MP4 in terms of difficulty or how long it takes to beat baseline? REPLY: 10 mins to break baseline:) REPLY: hmm.. it's taking me more than 10 minutes to figure out what I have to do.. :wink: REPLY: I won't even go there considering MP3 took me  more than a decade to finish REPLY: I would say try it, it's easy to break baseline at least and you will get 2% credit, I tried to come in top 10 in the list working few hours n then gave up being happy with 2% but yeah MP3 gave me restless nights REPLY: ok.. 20 minutes to tie the baseline... REPLY: agreed, MP4 is easy and 2% REPLY: Took me a few minutes to figure out what to do, but now agree...  it’s an easy few extra points... REPLY: Any of you actually look at the content of train.dat....  Gotta love Twitter users, lol. REPLY: Yes!  I was trying to figure out how we could actually group those by location.  It’s not like there were regional slang words in there that I saw... it was *all* inappropriate references, abbreviated slang and curse words..  REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> and <@UJAFNBRGX> did you guys play around with the Analyzers? I can't seem to get it to beat the baseline, my performance only goes down. Any tips? REPLY: I experimented with the analyzers, and made a few 'small' changes that seemed to bump my score up some.  In the end I did a lot of playing around with classifiers and some other parameters and scores went up and then down...  I'm not sure the small changes I made to the config.toml file really mattered in the end. :wink: REPLY: a minute after i posted, I revisted my toml file and found an error. Fixed that and everything worked. Thanks for the response though REPLY: i was able to beat the baseline for MP4 it was super easy. REPLY: How much time did you spend??? REPLY: Any tips?? 
THREAD: I am curious to know how everyone is feeling about their final projects.  I sat down today to get a trial done and ended up finishing the product in about 100 lines of python.  Is that 'too short' of a project compared to yours?  I built a customizable web scraper for application in my career field. REPLY: I think lines of code should not matter as far as project is related to current course and there is a learning. For eg except MP3 other assignments had learning but code was very minimal. In our project also we will end up with around 100 to 150 lines that's all REPLY: Based on what I heard from the office hours, they expect 40 hours of work. REPLY: At least your progress report will be easy to write: "Done." REPLY: 40 hours seems crazy...unless I design an entire GUI + webpage to go along with it. REPLY: I believe 40hrs of work also include debugging code etc REPLY: It also include preparing project doc, video etc REPLY: It is a lot of work. But it is worth 20% of grade. REPLY: I assume you haven’t gotten feedback yet on your project proposal? That will probably give you your answer. If the scope is acceptable, then the time to finish shouldn’t be an issue.  REPLY: Not sure any of us are going to end up getting feedback before the project is due, TBH... REPLY: cc <@UJ54TNBDZ> 
THREAD: just checked the plagiarism detection, apparently i have 1% similarity REPLY: hmm never done that. how do you do that?

THREAD: I am having problem understanding the fact that why do I exceed # of iterations in gitlab when I specify that I want my code to run 150 iterations ? Does anyone have this issue ? In gitlab I am seeing iteration running upto 391. REPLY: Your max iteration is not used in the unittests, there might be other value set by the test. You need to break when the threshold is exceeded (difference in likelihood &lt; epsilon) REPLY: But if I apply this logic i.e likelihood&lt;epsilon then I can't get the result because epsilon value is 0.001 and likelihood cannot be less than epsilon. REPLY: The goal is to get the DELTA likelihood less than epsilon.  That's why Sam said "difference in likelihood".  You must somehow keep track of the likehood values so you can compare the current iteration's value with the previous iteration's value. REPLY: abs(new_ll - old_ll) &lt; epsilon REPLY: just be sure how you do that as well. REPLY: if your returning and appending current value, you want make sure you are indexing the correct place in your list. REPLY: I don't think we should use abs() while finding the difference of the likelihoods. If the algorithm is correct then the new likelihood will always be greater then the old one making the difference always positive. If it's negative at any point it points to a defect in the code. Using abs() will hide this making debugging more difficult. REPLY: Thank you everyone for the help I was able to pass MP3 
THREAD: I am having a really hard time trying to figure out how to calculate P(z | d), can anyone point me in the right direction. the fact that the algorithm in the slides considers a background model and the mp does not is really confusing REPLY: P(z | d) is the product term_doc_matrix and topic_prob loops running from (number of docs) and (number of (topics) and (vocab size). After this you need to normalize it over the document ids. REPLY: if you are interested, you can take a look of @799 in MP3 of piazza. 
THREAD: Still need help with the term-doc matrix....python is not my strong suit and everything I'm trying isnt working. REPLY: since the value should be a count, not a list REPLY: (at some point I should probably warn that I've had a few beers which had a higher alcohol by volume than I initially suspected, so take anything I say with a grain of salt) REPLY: haha i need to have a beer REPLY: well I was watching the Panthers game so :disappointed: REPLY: i feel that on a spiritual level, currently listening to the Rams game REPLY: current output I am getting REPLY: if you have six terms that would be terms [0 - 5] REPLY: there wouldn't be an index of 6 REPLY: I dont see where it's picking up the extra index though REPLY: y = 0 is on the wrong line REPLY: if you are going to do it that way, you need to reset y after each document or it is going to keep increasing forever REPLY: your loop could also use range and that would prevent the need for extra variables and issues like this REPLY: ahh thank you REPLY: for currI in range (0, i): REPLY: if you had 4 documents (i=4) the command above iterates 0, 1, 2, 3 REPLY: no need for counter variables, clearing logic, etc. REPLY: got it! okay finally got the matrix to work!!! thank you guys! REPLY: and i was defined as :  i = len(self.documents)  for currI in range (0, i):  NOTE - I created an "i" variable since I was using self.documents / document count in multiple places and I didn't want to keep counting it over and over again. REPLY: so for the initialize_randomly function, i need to initialize the matrices right? REPLY: Yeah, use the np.random.random function, but don't forget to normalize 
THREAD: So who else is having fun right about now ? :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I am. Even though it is not fun anymore REPLY: I'm just going to say my slow for loop version is done so I can just drink beer and play Stellaris, so me REPLY: Pretty fun actually. Challenging, for sure, but so much more satisfying and engaging than the little toy projects like you find in most MOOCs REPLY: charles, cs425 once again killing us REPLY: wish i had another day or so for this assignment REPLY: Haven't even started on HW3.

REPLY: 1 ESTEP for each topic.  My understanding is the word_topic_prob distribution represents the word probabilities for Both Topic and Every step should update both Topic word distributions simultaniously...Let me now if i'm wrong? REPLY: so the topic_prob should be a three dimensional array, one dimension representing words, one documents, and one topics REPLY: sorry I meant to say topic_word_prob. 
THREAD: Just got mine working. I'd recommend double checking all the matrices. For me I made a silly mistake on the term-document matrix. REPLY: Did your likelihood converge even with the mistake you had? I am trying to see if this is similar to my case. I keep trying different things with the calculations and steps but I kind of think that maybe something else is wrong. Mine converges above 100 iteration and I end up with a likelihood difference less that epsilon, but pipeline tests timeout. REPLY: Yes, mine did. It worked after I closely examined all my code before the E-step. 
THREAD: Anybody tried matrix operations instead of for-loops ? Say in likelihood calculation ? Staring at the summation equation from couple of hours ... But nah ... :confused: REPLY: Never got ```np.dot``` to work. As a hint, however, ```np.einsum``` is much easier and more intuitive. 
THREAD: I am appending the log likelihood to the self.likelihood but when i am calculating the likelihood, when should I take the log ? REPLY: Maybe check out the last comment on this Piazza thread:  <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=730> REPLY: thnx <@ULZRHS1LP> 
THREAD: Any idea what might be going wrong here: My likelihood difference converges to the value of epsilon, but not within 50 iterations for test dataset REPLY: It might not be within 50... try 150 and see if that works. Mine was converging at a little over 100.. give or take depending on the random initialization.. REPLY: ^the pipeline won't use that max iterations variable -- that's just for testing.. REPLY: it converges around 110-140 for me, but can't get tests to pass. So, thanks for confirming tests could pass even when test dataset takes more iterations REPLY: (assuming your tests are passing :slightly_smiling_face:) REPLY: ^ They did :wink: . REPLY: yeah, they just timeout for me REPLY: <@ULZRHS1LP> Do you use number_of_topics in your E-step? REPLY: I don't. I originally added it in but was afraid it would affect the grader (others have said it doesn't), so I didn't use it. I update the entire column of my matrix (for each document/term combination) at once so I didn't need to count topic rows.  My code is a mix of different "whatever works" methods.. REPLY: Thank you Stephanie! I am now wondering if my simple vocabulary/documents and count building is the issue. I have tried so many different ways and still getting similar results in terms of convergence. But tests fail... 
THREAD: Any tips on getting the TAs to respond to a private message/question on piazza? I asked one about the exam right after taking it (so two weeks ago now) and have not received any response yet. I tried commenting on the post and making it again REPLY: Send a message to mcs-support if you don’t get a response on Piazza. REPLY: They'll respond at that email even for something course (and not logistics) related? REPLY: Yes, it will get routed to the instructors for the particular course and I guess they have some kind of SLA around response times. REPLY: Worked for me anyway :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Awesome. Thanks 
THREAD: So when you collect your z values from ESTEP they have to be normalized? I thought the ESTP equation normalized the values in the "denominator" REPLY: It's my understanding that the denominator normalizes it. REPLY: Precisely. The denominator does the normalization but can be done in a separate step. 
THREAD: is this the E-STP formula we need to implement? We don't need the Background, right? REPLY: that's correct, anytime you see that =B formula you can essentially ignore it from the equation because the probability of using it is 0 for our case REPLY: So we are updating both distributions at the same time in the ESTEP? REPLY: you're updating 1 matrix (the z values, topic_prob) using the other 2 matrix (topic_word_prob and document_topic_prob) REPLY: #T = self.topic_word_prob         #D = self.document_topic_prob         #E-step computes all Z's based on T and D REPLY: ^ that's from the readme i think REPLY: in the M-step, you update T and D using the Z values and the word count of the docs (term_doc_matrix) REPLY: Sorry, wrong question now thta I think about it REPLY: What I meant to ask was on each iteration of the ESTEP 2 seperate distributions? which will result in a [1000, 2, 6] matrix REPLY: [[[1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6]], [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6]]... -&gt; 1000]

I couldn’t call the number_of_topic because its not defined in the e-step. Do you have any idea what I can do here to get 2 step iteration? REPLY: Nevermind, I figured out that part. 
THREAD: Hi again, can someone please explain to me how the normalization work in the e-step code wise? I have the numerator as {1000 *6} but stuck at getting topic_prod to [1000*6*2] matrix.

I have added some logic, but it doesn't seem to help REPLY: I just used readlines and split('\n\t'). REPLY: split or strip? REPLY: have you tested against DBLP? REPLY: I used "with open ... as xx". Then for line in xx stripped the line first and split the line at spaces. I didn't specify anything for line end character. I passed the pipeline REPLY: Ohh I also checked if the returned array length was greater than zero. Maybe that avoided empty rows REPLY: I used split to split the lines at \t and \n.... REPLY: I figured it out, my issue was getting all the unique terms it was ok with test, but not with dblp fixed that and now I have no issue 
THREAD: is there a good way to troubleshoot, I feel like i'm shooting in the dark since I don't know why its failing? The first test passes, but the next 3 fail on the first iteration, not sure what's going on :man-shrugging: REPLY: Add print statements when in doubt, they will print in console output of the git pipeline as well REPLY: thanks, i wasn't sure if that was allowed, my pipelines have passed! REPLY: Read only 5-10 documents from the test set and print everything. The patterns should become clear.  
THREAD: E-step: Can someone explain to me summation in the denominator using numpy? I saw from reading posts that we should be normalizing through the columns not rows, this got me confused. I understand the multiplication of the 2 matrices using  np.dot(doc_topic_prod, topic_word), however, how would I iterate over the k topics ie. the summation? REPLY: i think you would use matmul instead 
THREAD: Can somebody explain what term-doc-matrix mean in terms of its structure? REPLY: It will be a matrix of length # of documents and width # terms in the vocabulary. REPLY: thanks REPLY: just to make sure, something like this? REPLY: Yes, exactly. 
THREAD: if we use for loops instead of numpy multiplication will that kill performance? i thought i had it correctly, but I fooled myself and now i'm struggling to make sense of how to multiply and add everything REPLY: I used numpy once, but mostly stuck to looping just because I wanted to be able to debug at each step and it was easier for me to think it through in loops. It worked fine and wasn't too slow on this particular set of test documents. Now that I've passed, I'm going back in to see if there's anywhere I can substitute in numpy... REPLY: kinda what i was thinking, i went the numpy route thinking it would fail with loops REPLY: i'll give it another 30 mins or so then do just straight loops REPLY: Thinking about it all makes my brain explode... REPLY: I was able to refactor after I got it to pass and now i have was using numpy multiplication for everything except the log likelihood which I'm not sure how to approach it. REPLY: I didn't use numpy at all and a passing pipeline ran pretty quick (although I never tested locally against the large dataset). Same as Stephanie I found it a lot easier to go step by step and understand what I was doing. It's been years since I've done anything with matrices :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: is it possible for the denominator to be 0? REPLY: I which case you are getting it 0? Denominator should not be 0 resulting in infinity. If all probabilities are 0 in a row then you need to randomize and normalize it to have non zero values REPLY: seems like i'm getting it in the m-step REPLY: There is a piazza post about this. Seems like there are some empty lines in the test data in the pipeline, so if you are splitting on newline you will get empty rows. That might be causing the zeros REPLY: ohhhhh 
THREAD: should log likelihood values be between 0 &amp; 1? REPLY: the likelihood will be between 0 and 1.  the log of that will be between negative infinity and 0 REPLY: ok i was seeing numbers like -100K or something and didn't know if that was the reason the pipeline is failing 
THREAD: Need help with generating the Term_doc_matrix: I tried using the For loop and Scipy,sparse_csr_matrix() but couldn’t the count of terms, Can anyone share a resource  that I can use to get this going? Any help is much appreciated REPLY: I completed it using pandas, but its failing because that module cannot be found ugh REPLY: sometimes scipy/numpy can be hard to work with. have you tried for loop and hash? REPLY: I have not the tried the hash. What class would I need to import for the hash <@UMWDN7SLQ>? REPLY: for small data set and to pass this MP3, you can use Counter on each document from  self.documents in one list comprehension (outer one).  Counter will return a set of key:value pairs.  Key is the term, and value is the frequency.  Then in another list comprehension (inter one), you extract the frequency by Counter(doc)[key] where key is term from self.vocabulary.  So you have two list comprehensions, one inside the other.  The result will be list of lists.  To convert it into matrix, use np.array.  This is just a one line code, ok for small data set, but not efficient for large data set.    Scipy,sparse_csr_matrix() is the way to go for large data set as it has been used in CountVectorizer from sklearn. REPLY: hash is build in python. it's a dictionary. for each word in each doc increment the counter that is stored in hash REPLY: Thank you. You guys are awesome! 
THREAD: OMG i passed…I really read into those equations and did a lot changes on the normalization:mario_luigi_dance: REPLY: what kindof changes in normalization? i am totally stuck in normalization. REPLY: I felt the same  like OMG when I passed tests REPLY: <@UJ4DCCYJK> mainly the M-step. M-step normalization is different than the initial step. I used the course slides and make sure all the denominators on the equations are correct REPLY: <@UJEU26EE5> ok.. let me check. REPLY: MP3 is the most challenging assignment by far. REPLY: Congratulations! REPLY: so we are supposed to normalize at the end of the E &amp;M-steps? I'm assuming its only the probabilities we are calculating for those functions we have to? REPLY: Yes - I had to normalize E and M (once for each step in M).  Yes, once you've calculated the probabilities you need to normalize across the row or column as appropriate. REPLY: <@UJEU26EE5>, do you mean that in the M step, we can not directly call self.topic_word_prob = normalize(self.topic_word_prob) and self.document_topic_prob = normalize(self.document_topic_prob) REPLY: <@UJ3PWQF46> Yes.  I wrote my own normalization for M step REPLY: Pretty wired. M step should be row level normalization. Why do you need to do different normalization. Could you explain the difference? REPLY: I used the provided normalize function for all normalizations. Performed transformations prior to ensure normalization happens across the correct dimension. This might not have been most efficient because on the big dataset my program was only on iteration #39 by morning. :-) 
THREAD: For stopping condition of the likelihood function, should I use `np.abs(curr_ll - prev_ll)` or should I use `np.abs((cur_ll - prev_ll) / preb_ll)` REPLY: No need to do the ratio, just abs(diff) is fine. REPLY: ^ agree.  This is what I used and passed.  There was another student on piazza that was getting incorrect results using the relative error formula. REPLY: I used the first out of your two options, and passed. 
THREAD: No, you need to customize your own normalization if needed. The given one is row-sum type. You can't use it for all scenario unless you want to keep trap of matrix transpose if you use it.  Sometime we need column-sum type.  Also sometime the normalization is a single value for all matrix elements.  In this case you can't use the given one.  The give one will return a matrix. REPLY: that is sneaky… i almost think that i should’ve used it all the time REPLY: but what about the `initialize_randomly` step? I figured these two matrices should be normalized row wise .. am i right? REPLY: I used the provided normalize() function there....  and now i’m thinking i could have used it in a few other places instead of looping and summing.... REPLY: haha,. I’m still experimenting REPLY: you can use it all the time but you have to design all your matrices in such a way that you can normalise by row or you need to do transformations before you normalise then put it back into shape REPLY: I think it's much easier to build your own normalisation function REPLY: I understand that in E step, it's column wise normalization. However, in M step, both those 2 normalization should be column wise right. If so, why cann't we use this function in M step? REPLY: Yes, I used the provided normalize function for all normalizations. Performed transformations prior to ensure normalization happens across the correct dimension. This might not have been most efficient because on the big dataset my program was only on iteration #39 by morning. :-) 
THREAD: E step is commented as updating P(z | w, d)...But variable self.topic_prob is commented as P(z | d, w).  Is it a typo or am I missing something in which variable to update? Also why doesn't np.dot accomplish this step if all I need is a product between two probability variables? REPLY: New issue: confused on how to turn a (1000,6) shape from np.dot into a (1000,2,6) shape for topic_prob.  Any advice is appreciated! REPLY: How many (1000,6) are in a (1000, 2, 6)? That should point you in the right direction REPLY: For those of you stuck, I finally passed after three hopeless nights.  My major solution was using this format instead of np.dot for multiplication:  self.topic_prob[a,b,c] = self.topic_word_prob[b,c] * self.document_topic_prob[a,b] REPLY: Thanks <@ULQ0GTSBC> for sharing this. But after this step, you still need to normalize the value by column right? REPLY: I ended up manually normalizing with loops and a denominator value.  I only used the given normalization function for initialize_randomly 
THREAD: has anyone had an issue with their LL values becoming smaller rather than larger after just 1-4 iterations through the test.txt data? Not sure what step the issue might be in. I suspect the M-step REPLY: mine goes more negative and then increases after that REPLY: are you passing the pipeline tests? I made some more changes and my LL now increases until it gets really close to zero on the test set, but doesn't pass the tests REPLY: it's my understanding that it should never get more negative if implemented correctly REPLY: yes - passed this morning :slightly_smiling_face:  darn for loop, python indents and terminology headaches... REPLY: did it pass going more negative then increasing? or did you fix that? REPLY: yes in general lower to higher but some variations as it moved along REPLY: hmm i think i have similar issue for my solution... REPLY: Might have solved already, but this happened to me when I was normalizing across the wrong dimension.  
THREAD: <https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/EMAlgorithm.html>   this example seems helpful for the programming assignmnet REPLY: That looks like a decent explanation. I finally got mine working.. it's not pretty.  I ran across a lot of examples of the EM algorithm in other areas so it seems like it would be a good general concept to understand more. REPLY: Not sure if this is cheating or not in that I would spend just as much time trying to understand it. Just looking through the solution I can see how my program could be improved.  REPLY: yeh i’m not a big fan for implementing algorithm but i guess that is the gist of the course… :joy: i used a EM library for some task before 
THREAD: has everyone been pushing their changes onto their master branch? I've done all my work on a separate branch and got a 0 on parts 1 and 2 bc of it (at least I'm hoping that's the reason). To my knowledge, it doesn't say everything has to go to the master branch anywhere REPLY: I've been pushing to master. Mostly just because I'm git-naive... REPLY: Does it go through the ci pipeline on other branches? REPLY: it does. the pipelines seem to be kicked off whenever a new commit is registered, regardless of branch REPLY: Then I'd recommend commenting on <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=774> REPLY: I have, posted here right after in case other's had the same issue REPLY: I pushed to master assuming their ci would not run on other branches.

THREAD: I have not received the grade for Mp2-part 3 REPLY: I haven't received grade for MP2-part3 as well. But, for MP2-part1 I received grade as 100%. Are you seeing grade for MP2-part1? REPLY: Yes. I have the grade for both part 1, 2 4 REPLY: They are having issues for part3, they are working to fix it. REPLY: Why all the weight's are showing as 0% for graded MP's on Coursera? REPLY: I have no grade for mp2-part3 either 
THREAD: Anyone seeing weight as 0% and Grade as 0% for MP2-part1 under Coursera grades? REPLY: And for all MP's weight's are showing as 0% in Coursera REPLY: I'm seeing grade 100% but weight 0% REPLY: Are you seeing grade as 100% for MP2-part1? REPLY: I am seeing grade 100%, weight 0% for MP2-part1 REPLY: It got corrected now. I misspelled bois.txt instead of bios.txt for MP2-part1. Now, the grade is adjusted on Coursera. REPLY: Hey Siva, on making the change to the file name, in how much time you received the updated coursera grades. I did a mistake in placing significance.txt inside an existing folder. REPLY: TA adjusted the grade immediately and reflected the change in Coursera. 
THREAD: ^ This. The answers on Piazza keep referring back to the original response that says "tentatively next week" which was 2 weeks ago.  I'm inclined to just go forward.  Anyone else procrastinating like me? REPLY: Definitely.  Or maybe just realizing that I'm behind on the coursework in general at this point.  lol. REPLY: Yes, not for lack of work.  I'm not in love with my project idea anymore... may try to change it up. REPLY: Not procrastinating, just a matter of competing priorities and the fear of wasting time on something that hasn't been approved yet.  With that said, our group is going to have a meeting Friday to start dividing up tasks, etc.  Don't think we can afford to wait too much longer on feedback for fear of not enough time to complete project. 
THREAD: For the test.txt corpus, should I see convergence in &lt;50 iterations?   Right now I'm seeing convergence at just over 100 iterations...  Does it seem like I have an issue somewhere? REPLY: I have asked the same question on Piazza and the response was no we don't have to get convergence in 50 iteration, that's not the expectation. Having more iteration for convergence also do not mean your code has issues. Also Just so every one know the test cases on CI/CD will try to run you E-Z steps 3500 to 4000 times. REPLY: Also for test.txt file my code took 115 iterations and I am able to pass the CI/CD test. REPLY: Perfect. Thank you both!! Going to give a shot at passing the CI/CD pipeline... hopefully it will pass.. and then I can start cleaning up my spaghetti code. 
THREAD: I'd suggest removing the tabs and newlines.  That very likely is the reason for the difference in term counts.  The newlines should be removed as well.  But they probably aren't throwing off your results.  Treating '\tseattle' and 'seattle' differently is probably changing things. REPLY: Right after removing \t now am getting count of 6 instead of 8, thanks much 
THREAD: Are you doing any sort of processsing?  The doc and topic sizes should be the same for everyone (barring some weird stuff creating dynamic tests).  But all of us could be doing pre-processing that might change the number of terms per document.  I'm doing nothing other than splitting on whitespace. REPLY: I am doing same as you mentioned splitting on whitespace. 8 is basically a vocab size. I am also removing \n in last  in each line REPLY: For eg here: ['grasslands', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'grasslands', 'grasslands', 'waterfall', 'tiger', 'lion', 'lion', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'tiger', 'boats', 'grasslands', 'lion', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'lion', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'lion', 'lion', 'screwdriver', 'tiger', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'toy', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'river', 'tiger', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'lion', 'tiger', 'lion', 'lion', 'lion', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'tiger', 'lion', 'grasslands', 'fish', 'grasslands', 'rainforest', 'grasslands', 'tiger', '\n'] REPLY: you see \n in last, so I am removing this as well and then adding it an self.documents array 
THREAD: I see almost the same thing.  But my first test case has 6 words, not 8. REPLY: Are you able to pass all tests? 
THREAD: Also, would like to know the use of self.likelihoods in likelihood function as I don;t see it getting used anywhere? REPLY: you don't use it anywhere, you only append to it `def calculate_likelihood` REPLY: so once you calculate the value, store it in there. The unit test in gitlab likely uses this to tell if your code is good or not 
THREAD: is the PLSA function supposed to return something? Or if not, what is the gitlab unit test checking? REPLY: No, The pipeline tests will use the Corpus class to instantiate objects(one for each test) and then call each object’s PLSA method.  It can check the object’s data member for result. REPLY: makes sense, I see that we are supposed to be building the self.likelihoods list so I see how it will be validated now 
THREAD: ... and yeah.... there is a lot more work to do in this MP than the prior ones... going to be a busy week... yikes REPLY: Agree on both points.  I have a good friend that works for gitlab and about to give him an ear full! lol REPLY: I’d wager it’s not gitlab’s fault, but the set up for this course. Looks like it is self-hosted at the university with insufficient resources  REPLY: Good point.  I think I'm confusing with the original URL that referenced gitlab directly REPLY: <@UARSGQKS7> - The real question is do they have sufficient failure detection for those distributed systems?  :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Clearly not hahaha  REPLY: <@UMBMJ3B9N> I think they have 467 failure detections REPLY: <@UMW0NBSDT> - Perhaps, but those failure detectors are only active monitoring ACK/NAK during homework submission periods. 
THREAD: How long should it take to run on DBLP? There are ~30K terms accross ~10K documents. REPLY: I think I saw someone either here or on Piazza say it took over an hour to run on the DBLP data. I haven’t gotten there myself... 
THREAD: Is there anything in the course on using numpy matrices for things like the E-step function? Fighting the urge to use loops which I'm much more familiar with REPLY: I'm not sure you can do much with e-step. m-step there are shortcuts, but I think a couple transposes are required. I say I think because I haven't tested yet. Just have the likelihood method to implement now. 
THREAD: ah yes, indeed, normalization error REPLY: Thank you! I made the same mistake and this led me to the issue. 
THREAD: for the test.txt file, are we supposed to skip the first 100 rows that are already labeled "0" or "1"? Not sure what the purpose of those labels are in the context of the assignment. REPLY: tl;dr I'm clueless too I imported them, minus the 0 or 1.  But I'm not sure whether that's the right thing to do yet.  Maybe we just use those as a check against our results? REPLY: yes, I also skipped importing 0 and 1 column. I used it to check against my results - corpus.document_topic_prob. REPLY: I just passed all unit tests on my first submission. REPLY: thanks, makes the most sense to me to just strip those as well REPLY: I ignored them completely while writing the code. It is only required if you run the `main` routine. Don't worry about adjusting your code for something that does not matter at all for the pipeline. Create a local file by removing those lines from the text file and use it for your tests rather than generating statements to avoid those lines. I passed the pipeline without running anything locally. REPLY: Yes... those are there to confirm the functionality of your implementation.  Don't skip the rows.  That would defeat the purpose.  Skip that column.  Save those labels somewhere else... another file... another array/list, etc.  Then when your program is working, grab the result of your PLSA run for those first 100 rows.  It should be perfectly matched or perfectly anti-correlated.  You aren't required to do this.  But that's why those labels are there. 
THREAD: Hi Folks, Can someone explain pr point me to resources regarding the Build_corpus()  and Build_vocabulary() section of MP3. Is it as straight forward as just picking words and updating the size of each object as stated in the code comments? Also, what differentiates the words used in the document vs. vocabulary? For instance, the vocabulary section says to choose unique words and gave “the” as an example but “the” is not unique and could be considered a stop word, am I missing something? I am also wondering if we need look through the text data to choose what words to put in the 2 mentioned functions? Thanks! REPLY: I think you asked this on piazza as well. I answered it there REPLY: For those two functions I used the comments in the code to help me figure out what was needed.  My documents function simply loaded in the txt file into a list of lists - with separate word elements inside a document list inside a documentS list.   Unique words actually refers to your vocabulary list and not the corpus.  A word can appear 20 times in the corpus but should only appear once in your vocabulary list.  Basically your vocabulary list should be a unique “set” of words.  Disclaimer:  I’m not much farther along than that and haven’t been able to submit anything yet for testing so this is my interpretation of the guidelines; but it seems to make sense for what will be needed for next steps.   REPLY: Thank you Stephanie! REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0>  did you use nltk to build the corpus and vocabulary or we don’t need to import this library? REPLY: I did not use any library.... just ran a scan through all the documents to build both those structures. REPLY: ^ I did the same.. just used readlines to add each line (i.e. document) 
THREAD: I haven't actually  tried submitting my MP3 to the pipeline yet - not even at a point where that makes sense (and not that I *could* right now even if I wanted to),  but curious whether it provides any checkpoint type messages along the way -- i.e. even basic ones like document count is good, vocabulary size is good etc...   anything to help know you're moving along in the right direction...  ? REPLY: Nope... It'll just tell you if the unit tests passed or not. You're pretty much on your own beyond that. You'll have to put print statements in your code to see what it's doing. REPLY: Thank you..  That’s what i’ve been doing so far.   Was just hoping the unit tests might provide some incremental type logs that would tell if you failed something due to wrong initial docs/ vocabulary definitions or whether it failed later on due to  a larger formula error etc..   I’ll just have to jump in and start submitting....

Makes life easy(ier) as I can quickly go b ack to that to decipher these formulas, etc.  Not as bad as it looks once you get used to what all that stuff means, but still makes your head hurt ..... 
THREAD: <@UF4G83FL3> how was CS412? (For those of us considering it this Spring) REPLY: I enjoyed the course. Found it harder and more academic than 410 (so far) but then I was learning Python from scratch as well. The assignments were interesting. Certainly more calculations required on the tests though we were allowed to bring in a cheat sheet. Extremely organized and well run course. CS410 has so far taught me more practical application. I definitely feel like a boss being able to scrape any web page and am now constantly thinking of how to exploit this new skill. I plan to take the data mining capstone next fall so for me both were required. Would be great if NLP made it into spring 2021. #NLP2021 REPLY: <@UF4G83FL3>, you’re hoping to take it next fall? As far as I can see, it’s only offered in Spring &amp; Summer: REPLY: <https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-master-computer-science/online-master-computer-science-data-science> REPLY: Thanks for the update! Looks like I’m taking it in the summer. ;-) REPLY: One other thing about CS412: They do not give you skeleton programs for assignments like in 410. You are given a problem to solve and then you go solve it. Perhaps others could do it in less code, but my decision tree assignment was 360 lines of python (using lists only). There was 7 assignments but no final project. REPLY: I disliked the lectures immensely - they consisted mainly of the slides being read at you. I wound up having to actually go look up some of the papers mentioned as source materials to figure out what was going on. TAs were helpful, and the MPs were pretty good!

I'm pretty sure I'm not ahead, unless I missed a whole section :wink:  If so, yes. I'm only on the first lecture and already having to rewind and replay sections several times over.  It doesn't help that the slides end up with text all over the place as he's explaining things... I don't know which formula goes with what :wink: REPLY: Oh yes probably. I'm definitely behind! :see_no_evil: REPLY: I'd be putting it off, but I heard that it's helpful to have a background on PLSA for MP3.... REPLY: MP3, the audio format? (that's how much behind I am) REPLY: I feel  Week10(on Coursera) is bit complicated compare to previous weeks. I am also doing rewind and replay several times to understand the formulas. Moreover PLSA algorithm is explained in week10 that is related to MP3. If you are coming from data science background it might be easy for them. That is why some of them already completed MP3. REPLY: I don’t know how we are expected to turn in mp3 by Nov 10 given that PLSA is apparently discussed in week 10 (on Coursera) which is due the same week as mp3 REPLY: Given that we are on Week 10 of Coursera, it seems like we have very little time for MP3. REPLY: looks like we need to understand the topics covered in Week10 before we can attempt MP3 REPLY: I thought I've been going week-for-week and I'm on week 8/9 content today REPLY: Week 9 Coursera already has office-hours recordings attached from Oct 22-27, so I was assuming that this week's office hours would cover week 10 Coursera.

Actually working on CS425 HW3 this week first, then MP3 for 410.  ugh REPLY: I'm definitely finding it more difficult as well. I thought I caught back up after taking some time to focus on studying for the exam, but I feel like this material will take longer to absorb... REPLY: Thanks all for the heads up. I'm also just now finishing up week 8. Having read this, I'll prioritize getting caught up. REPLY: It's definitely the most complex part of this course... it took me forever to  just wrap my head around stuff, I still don't get all the details.

REPLY: I preferred the CS425 exam to this one.  *NOT* because it was easier, but simply having a handful of multiple choice questions is kinda annoying since you have no room for partial or exam questions to recover from any dumb mistakes.  I missed a couple due to brain failures and there was a question I knew I didn't know which was on there.  (of course it would be)  Did fine on this, but I'd just rather have questions where you can explain thought process and work through problems as opposed to a low number of multiple choice all/nothing type questions. 
THREAD: The practice quizzes are very similar. You could just go back and review or re-take them. I studied by going through the study guide and paying extra attention to the underlined sections as suggested (good idea). If it tells you to know something, then know it. I went back and re-watched a couple of sections because I couldn't quite make out the meaning from my notes. In particular I benefited from going back and watching week 4 concerning language models. In doing this I realized I didn't fully understand the equations and what they meant the first time through. This also prompted me to go back and better understand how the formula for BM25 is derived which helped me understand some of the results in MP2-Part4. k1 is related to term frequency for instance. Those that scored high on the faculty set may find that interesting. I did not find the test as challenging as CS412. REPLY: totally agree Alan. I wish we could go back and do the competition again, because i learned so much more when really studying the material for the test. 
THREAD: Whoever is still planning for Exam1 - it is pretty straightforward. don’t overthink over the solutions  REPLY: thanks.  Taking tomorrow.  if that's true it would be better than some of the quizzes REPLY: I found it straight forward too. Made a silly mistake in one question. REPLY: Does reviewing past practice quiz can get me a 70%? I just find the videos are too long and was wondering how much benefit of watching all of it... 
THREAD: ^ I have to say that reading the book is very useful after watching videos, etc.,....  I find there is so much more detail in the book (not really a surprise....) that helps to fill in some gaps from the lectures, especially AFTER you spent some time trying to think through the lecture / assignment / etc. REPLY: Which book? REPLY: The suggested textbook for the course... Almost all the content is identical but reading at slowly paragraph by paragraph and staring at each eq for some time helps... REPLY: I have been reading each chapter after watching the videos every week. Plus the excercise questions at the end of the chapter are more challenging than the quizzes i felt. Clears up hidden misunderstandings REPLY: I honestly am preferring the book over the lectures tbh and reference it first over lecture materials REPLY: I may have to give this another try.. I gave up since the book was basically a clone of the lectures (or vice versa) - even down to some of the ambiguous  wording. I was looking for different real world examples than in the lectures; but, for the most part they were exactly the same with the same diagrams to illustrate them etc...  It does help being able to 'read' something though to reinforce what you heard at 2x speed :wink: . I do think it will be good reference once the class is over for looking up things I've forgotten. REPLY: Thanks! What is the name of the book? It’s good to keep reference. 
THREAD: I'd like to amend my previous statement as "...rewatch all the lectures at 2x speed, until I get that a-ha moment, and redo the practice quizzes" lol REPLY: yeah, i can’t wait until Elon Musk gets NeuralLink working! multi-threaded brain downloads. 
THREAD: i had to focus on the videos for last 3 days… because a lot of material in the video were asked. REPLY: I had watched all the lectures again, but more in terms of understanding the quizzes. I would have changed my focus had I known. Still very salty about it 
THREAD: Any suggestions? REPLY: study everything more than just the practice quizzes 
THREAD: i did not do as well as I would have thought REPLY: yeah, very easy to get caught up in the wording.  but, i wouldn’t worry too much. Looks like we have a few chances to get extra credit. REPLY: that pisses me off REPLY: i don't feel it was an accurate reflection of the overall course REPLY: Same here.. I studied SO much.... and knew the formulas as presented in the lectures pretty well I thought.  I was super disappointed.  Some questions felt like they were trick questions..and i fell for it I guess..  REPLY: Only in academia smh REPLY: Same.  I watched all the videos at least twice, took copious notes, got 100% on all quizzes, retook the practice quizzes, and read the study guide, but I bombed the test (55%).  It was so broad, and with just 20 questions you don't have much room for error.  Good luck to those yet to take it!! REPLY: signed up for tomorrow, we'll see how it goes. 
THREAD: Yes, the proctor from ProctorU should have the password REPLY: So on Coursera ProctorU Password - Exam 1 will be taken care of by Proctor and then and exam1 will be unlocked on Coursera?

THREAD: It's good to create a separate account and use that when you take the test on a Mac...so that you don't lose any of your everyday configurations REPLY: good idea! 
THREAD: They just check if have screen sharing enabled and close any open apps REPLY: Last time, the proctor put my Mac on do not disturb mode and disabled my screen capture keyboard shortcuts. REPLY: Me too, you also have to give their application access to control your computer (you can remove this afterwards) 
THREAD: they change all sorts of systems settings to make your computer unsecure, and then disabled things i use like screen shotting, etc… so i had to figure out how to bring them all back, since they don’t reverse what they do. REPLY: Upgrading to Catalina reset all my app permissions so I needed to give them permissions again. You can turn them back on by going to settings. I usually just search “screenshots” and it should direct you to the right place.   If you don’t ask them to do it at the end of the session, they will almost always forget. I used to create a separate login just for taking the tests so I don’t have to bother remembering to set it back later.  REPLY: That's a good idea 
THREAD: Why on Coursera MP1 grades are showing as 0%? Is it Coursera issue? REPLY: There was a lost on Piazza about that... yesterday i think..

THREAD: Wouldn't you typically have a small subset of training data? REPLY: i didn’t get it.. maybe i misunderstood the purpose of this exercise… aren’t we suppose to have a large training set and test on a masked set REPLY: No sorry, I was speaking in general terms. I thought in most cases you would at least have a small subset of the real data to train on and the rest would be masked for testing.  For this assignment we have the large cranfield but nothing from the other two. 
THREAD: For the purposes of this exercise, masked. REPLY: that works, but we will only have a biased training dataset. would be great if we could have sampled training data from the other two datasets 
THREAD: exam time, wish me luck REPLY: good luck Nick! REPLY: how was it Nick? Questions mostly from Quizzes ? REPLY: I can't really speak to specifics, but I believe they've stated the quizzes are a good thing to study

THREAD: You can beat baseline with bm25 REPLY: On leader board check rank 18 "allie" it's without BM25... It's not mandatory to use BM25 only .... 
THREAD: Hey folks, I am having difficulty with MP2-part4. Do we have to also modify search_eval.py for the BM25 method for cranfield  data or just need to modify the config.toml with the chosen ranker method and then run the program? Also I am using atom text editor to do my assignment and I am not able to see the outputs when I run the program. Do I have first pull, commit to gitlab to be able to see the output? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks! REPLY: You only need to modify the search_eval.py file, specifically the "def load_ranker()" function. When the code is run for the competition it uses its own config.toml files, so you can make changes there if you want to play around when you run it locally but it will have no effect for the competition REPLY: In order to get your output on the leaderboard, assuming you followed all the steps in the PDF from the readme to set the aliases, you just need to commit your code and a job will automatically kick off that should finish within 2 mins or so (unless things are running behind). If you wanted to run your code locally, you could, but we only have the cranfield data set, everything else is basically a secret. From whatever directory your files are stored in you would run `python search_eval.py config.toml` from the command line and it should output the score from the cranfield data set REPLY: Thank you so much Kyle! This was very helpful. Regarding the command line, I have tried running on the Mac terminal with python2.0 but it gave me an error that it’s couldn’t parse the config.toml.  I changed the directory to python3 and that’s says there is no such file. I saw on piazza that there is some compatibility issues with python 3.7. Can you give me an example of how to run the python search_eval.py config.toml on Mac terminal or just on python terminal?  REPLY: I'm running mine from within my IDE.  I just adjusted the script so it automatically uses the config.toml file and doesn't require me to run it from command line (too lazy to work with two windows...) . #### UNCOMMENT FOR SUBMISSION     # if len(sys.argv) != 2:     #     print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))     #     sys.exit(1)      # *** COMMENT OUT OR REMOVE FOR SUBMISSION     if len(sys.argv) !=2:        cfg = 'config.toml'     else:        cfg = sys.argv[1]      # UNCOMMENT FOR SUBMISSION     #cfg = sys.argv[1]

THREAD: <@UM5B71WMA> I did not check to make sure im hitting all eight core I just assumed it would. I am now looking into this GIL effect for a work aroundif possible. I'm thinking about re-writting it in c if I have time. REPLY: Np. Only reason i ask, is because i’ve been trying to get multi-threading working in python for years. It never works fast, and multiprocess hangs.. I heard folks were working on a fix, so just curious.  But like you said c/c++ you see all the cores activate, and i love seeing like 1600% CPU utilization in ‘top’ vs python maxes at 100%. 
THREAD: but after the assignment due date is over, i’ll share the entire k1, b, k3 mapping space. where i picked 3 values for k3, incremented b by .1 and k by .05..  have a dictionary of every result that  scraped from the leaderboard. REPLY: AFAIK k3 is the term weighting parameter for the query vector. Setting it to a high value (like the default of 500) makes it redundant for all practical purposes since the queries are so small in cranfield. I tried brute force too but I hard coded k3 making my possible value space much smaller. REPLY: What values did you try for k3? 
THREAD: I'm wondering if the person currently at the top of the leaderboard is using 3 different sets of parameters based on the dataset being tested. I'm not sure if this is in the spirit of the competition or not, but their scores for each of the datasets seems highly optimized. REPLY: I would challenge you to find a way to achieve a score on the cranfield set that matches the top score on that set. If you can't do it, then perhaps you need to re-look at all of your assumptions. There's plenty to learn in this assignment if you want to dig deeper. 
THREAD: it like a guessing game to me. REPLY: Seems like to find needle in dark room.... 
THREAD: And, people will try hard…. the pipeline got this error. REPLY: doesn't matter I think, because I see ranks are getting updated REPLY: Yes.  but it is out of spaces for their backup cache.zip REPLY: Don’t know why they need to zip up the result or something.

THREAD: Check the alias configuration REPLY: what exactly is it? REPLY: @595 REPLY: Copying from Piazza : I would strongly suggest you double check that you have added the variable COMPETITION_ALIAS to your CI/CD settings per the instructions.  Doubly check the spelling of said variable.  I saw at least 3 people last night/yesterday having this issue and it was the variable spelling each and every time.     If the variable is missing / misspelled, your results get to submitted as Anonymous REPLY: ok thanks, I will look into it 
THREAD: i don’t see any info from the instructors REPLY: They posted a study guide here:  <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=392>. Other than that I think they just posted that it is 20 multiple choice questions and 1 hr in length.  Deadline is 10/26 or 10/27 -  there was some debate about which date was correct on Piazza...  REPLY: thanks Stephanie! i was searching midterm. REPLY: Yeah I need to schedule that test.... was so consumed with CS425, that I didn't even want to think about bothering with this one. 
THREAD: Any tips for showing your score on the leaderboard. I am able to pass the ci/cd pipeline? REPLY: It should automatically update.  Did you set up the COMPETITION_ALIAS ? REPLY: ya this is what i have REPLY: How come your build is working without GIT_LAB_TOKEN ? REPLY: I just took it off because it was not showing on the leaderboard. But I have added it again and it is still not showing on the leaderboard. I have also updated the screenshot. REPLY: You misspelled COMPETITION_ALIAS REPLY: If you have that wrong, your score gets submitted as Anonymous .... 
THREAD: This message was deleted. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=590> REPLY: ~I'm not seeing my results show in the scoreboard either, but maybe it just takes a little while?~ Forgot to include the COMPETITION_ALIAS variable for the pipeline... REPLY: I got the storage error too, but doesn't seem to affect the results. REPLY: Do you see your result showing up on the score board? I cannot get mine to show up REPLY: Yes, it is there. Maybe follow the instructions from MP1 again from scratch to be sure. Also note that your commit must show as a green check mark in GitLab for it to post to the leaderboard. You can see submission times on the leader board to know if others are able to post. 
THREAD: The whitepapers clearly state that properly tuning BM25 is complicated *and* is very dataset dependent.  This is why the exercise is challenging.  We have 3 different datasets, two of shich, we cannot even see. REPLY: I agree and its very time consuming since you have to wait for the score REPLY: Which value did you loop, k only? 
THREAD: <@UANL30ZDK> Agree. I'm taking Numerical Analysis (450) as well and that's more stress for sure...   This class is pretty balanced, but sometimes that means it gets pushed aside for the other ..  I should have only taken one class, but I'm not getting any younger.. REPLY: off topic , do you find Numerical analysis to be useful ? REPLY: Yes..and no. There are definitely some underlying concepts - i.e. vectors, SVD, optimization etc that will be helpful in later classes.  I'm enjoying the class, but my math background isn't recent and it feels like there is a lot more 'glossing' over of things than I would have hoped.  It's a ton of work for me (possibly not as much for others).  I'm definitely enjoying the  programming assignments.. the midterm not so much :wink:  The TAs/instructors are pretty responsive and helpful on Piazza. 
THREAD: OK so if you were just testing any results on the leaderboard while the baseline was messed up, it affected all results that were processed. I just re-ran the same ranker now that I did 15 minutes ago and the scores are wildly different REPLY: are you getting better scores or worse? REPLY: better, before everything was around .27ish 
THREAD: In a real life situation, wouldn't we have some access then to the actual dataset to train?  With a subset of the same dataset held out for testing?  It does seem like it's just throwing things out there to see what happens.  I basically looped through to find an optimal score for Cranfield, then backed it off a bit since that seemed to be what the leaders had done.. and that brought up my score a little on the other two datasets -- and I hit baseline.  I'll probably make a few more attempts and read up on other techniques when I have time, but I'm not sure this is time effective. I hate to 'settle' for ordinary, but could use the time for the project and midterm :wink: REPLY: That’s my mindset as well. I tried, to but I’m not going anywhere. So goal is to just optimize above baseline. 
THREAD: Builds fail now &gt; Got 56 queries, expected 54 &gt; <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=584> REPLY: This is only happening for me when I try to use a custom ranker instead of one of the metapy rankers 
THREAD: by the way who is @yululiu2? REPLY: I tried to beat that score, but its very time consuming REPLY: My ranking keep sinking.. REPLY: I will have #1, oh yes, I will have #1.......  muhaha muhaha muhahahahahahah 
THREAD: ^ yes, you will have problems if you over optimize on cranfield.  My highest cranfield scores resulted in not meeting benchmark. REPLY: yikes, thanks for the info 
THREAD: since the pipeline is broken and I'm unable to check my scores across all the datasets from MP2.4, can anyone say if overfitting is a serious concern or not for this task? Is it worth my time trying to optimize on the cranfield set alone or is that just a waste of my time? REPLY: i wish they would have just given the data sets locally.

What I meant was, they should be clear about all the dates beforehand and everything on Coursera must be updated. As a full-time working professional, I don't have time to read every Piazza post since the instructors already flooded Piazza with the extra credit decision. All it did was making lots of unnecessary posts and it became difficult to catch few notes provided by instructors. REPLY: <@UEPRPCF8Q> Agree, I think they should create one main page kind of dashboard to display all upcoming deadlines and quiz/exam results etc REPLY: For other courses i used Coursera Grades page for the same - i think they should update that page with these additional tasks/projects REPLY: Piazza is a forum. And forums AFAIK are for ad-hoc discussions not for declaring source of truth. Especially if that info is frequently changing ... Am I right or am I right ...

REPLY: i started with that PDF, which really just resulted in me reviewing every slide and making sure i understood what was on them (esp. equations). i also reviewed the past quizzes. i felt like that was adequate preparation. Most of the questions were very straightforward, the ones that weren’t were able to be deduced if you understand the underlying concepts. so basically like any exam in this program :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: REPLY: Thank you Jeff :blush:

THREAD: Hi, can someone please clarify the late policy for submitting MP assignment? I check the syllabus and states that no late work will be accepted but I am getting conflicting statements from piazza post. REPLY: *Course Policy and Grading - CS410 Text Information Systems* (Not sure if it's same for Fall 2019 as well)   Late submission of an assignment would result in a reduced grade for the assignment, unless an extension has been granted by the instructor. *An assignment is worth at most 90% credit for the next 24 hours* after the deadline. *It is worth at most 75% credit for the following 24 hours*. *It is worth 50% credit after that, but within two weeks of the deadline.* Unless in exceptional cases, assignments will generally not be accepted if they are two weeks later after the due date, which means that if your assignment is turned in 14 days later than the due date, it would not be graded and you would receive zero credit for the assignment. If you need an extension, please ask for it by sending email to the instructor as soon as the need for it is known.  *source* <https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs410/sp2017/> 
THREAD: quick question… should we put the result under root directory (MP2-part2) REPLY: Yes, 
THREAD: I got the test passing before attempting to deal with p-value, now I just realized there is no way to know if p is correct as there is no test case for it REPLY: Yes, it sounds like a human will go in and check the p-value in the text file 
THREAD: How quickly are unit tests running. Originally it was 5 minutes, but now they are failing in less than a minute. It has me concerned I've done something very bad on a checkin, but the failure isn't helpful. REPLY: You’ll not get much details to troubleshoot if pipeline fails. But mostly it’s failing because of formula under *score_one* function not implemented correctly... (if it’s mp2 part2) REPLY: I did notice that the pipeline was running much faster than 2 or 3 hours ago REPLY: Today is deadline of assignment submission might be build agents are busy.....  REPLY: I've been at this for 2 days, first run was 5 minutes, all runs subsequent have failed in less than 60 seconds. I have tinkered with the formula for 2 days and it looks right, that's why I'm wondering if I have broken something, as I get a file not found error REPLY: <@UFBB64T7S> I struggled for hours not because my formula was wrong but because how I set the parameter (or where I set the parameter). REPLY: I caught that error yesterday morning where I missed setting c REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: If I may ask, what’s the p value that’s acceptable? I’m not sure if my p value is close to right  REPLY: I don’t think the value matter. I believe  any value will be fine REPLY: ah thanks!

THREAD: so, 1. make the term to 1 as per: You need to override this function to return a score for a single term. For fields available in the score_data sd object, 2. add the formula ? REPLY: No need to overthink  here, you just need to provide implementation as per give formula. sd object contain all required information that you need to develop formula REPLY: read c(t,D) as term count in document, c(t,Q) as term count in query. So implement tfn first.  then get remaining part of formula from sd and link all parts per formula 
THREAD: It is just a test for `is_close == True`. So probably some calculations that compare your results and determine if it _is close_ REPLY: Results in text file or what they get from running the code?  REPLY: What format did you have for the text files?  REPLY: Results from running the code REPLY: ``` Your grade will be based on:   passing the pipeline on gitlab uploading singificance.txt with the p-value ``` The file name has to be named significance.txt REPLY: I am sorry just want to know the format of the files - should they contain programs standard output or list of floats?

THREAD: My optimal MAP with the inL2ranker is lower than my MAP with the BM25 ranker default parameters. Did that happen to anyone else? I'm worried I implemented inL2 wrong, but the pipeline passed. REPLY: Yup I got this as well. REPLY: my understanding: if you pass pipeline, you implementation is correct.  The pipeline should invoke your implementation of inL2. I got the same as yours. REPLY: that is not correct REPLY: if you look at the pipeline output it is doing a "similar" comparison; therefore, there is some expected variance.  Because of that, your formulas could be wrong, but yet you still pass CI/CD. REPLY: " $ python /data/cs410/mp2/mp2_part2_unit_test.py /data/cs410/mp2/mp2_part2_unit_test.py:48: DeprecationWarning: Please use assertEqual instead.   self.assertEquals(*is_close*, True) " REPLY: What they should have done with this assignment is tell was what the MAP should be for a given value of "c".  That would allow you to know that your formulas is right. REPLY: additionally, if the "c" value did not lead to the optimal MAP value, there would be zero impact in disclosing that REPLY: For example if they said... with a c of ".01", your Mean Average Precision would be 0.18434, then you could validate your formula.  Further, since 0.18434 isn't the optimal MAP, it wouldn't cause any harm to disclose that REPLY: agree. Thanks for clarifying. REPLY: Yeah, it's not ideal. REPLY: I will say that my implementation also performed worse than BM25 but passed the pipeline REPLY: NOTE _ I raised this to instructors to see if they find it acceptable to post a sample "c" / MAP value to help people validate their formulas.....   (e.g. sample above :slightly_smiling_face:  ) REPLY: I have to do CS425 now....  :male_zombie: REPLY: Will we be graded based on what we put in our significance.txt? My search_eval.py passed the test in the pipeline but I didn’t know if I had to keep tweaking with my c parameter and what the p value had to be in the end? REPLY: I don't think the value matters as long as we provide the file itself with a value in it. My understanding is that part 4 will be concerned with the actual optimization, this part was just to get us to implement the algorithm. 
THREAD: So with the above, you can develop in your windows environment from vs code and connect remotely to the linux environment without ever having to leave your windows environment. You can install extensions for both environments as well. REPLY: That's pretty cool, I'll use that from now on. Thanks Derek! 
THREAD: What are people finding is the best overall development environment for this class? Currently I use WSL-Ubuntu and Windows, but I have to keep going between the two (and transferring files repeatedly) because neither seems to do well as a dev environment by itself.  (Editing in WSL isn't awesome, since all we have are command-line editors like Nano and no Jupyter Notebooks--plus we can't copy into the bash command line--but on the other hand, a lot of things seem designed to be done in Linux) REPLY: still on W7 here, so no WSL for me - VMWare Player + Ubuntu is working ok so far. I installed PyCharm in the VM and mounted the directory with all the cloned repos for this course 
THREAD: In regards to 'R', anyone using R for Windows to do this?   My linux image wouldn't cooperate when I tried to install R REPLY: I used R Studio in Windows, and didn't have any issues. I'm going between WSL and Windows (and copying files as needed from WSL bash), since neither environment seems to be able to stand on its own as a dev environment. Quite frustrating--hopefully someday I'll have time to set up a better env. 
THREAD: Funny you asked about iCard, mine literally showed up today REPLY: Same actually, just went to check the mail again and there it was! 
THREAD: Assignment Question (no, nothing confidential) - Do we need to do anything with the following results?  "Choose one of the above retrieval functions and one of its parameters (don’t choose BM25 + k3, it’s not interesting). For example, you could choose Dirichlet Prior and mu.  Change the ranker to your method and parameters. In the example, it is set to bm25. **Use at least 10 different values** for the parameter you chose; try to choose the values such that you can find a maximum MAP."  It seems like this is just for us to experiment and see how the paramter change impacts the results.  We are not required to save / upload these results? REPLY: Yeah I saw a piazza post where one of the TA's said that part is just exploratory. REPLY: Not what I was expecting, either haha REPLY: yeah, some of the assignment guidance is a bit vague, but usually they are quick to answer or clarify. REPLY: I think this part is important for part 4 where you have to create IR system REPLY: so exploring what works and doesn't work will help with that 
THREAD: i was sooo full of myself going into part 2.. i was like this is going to take 30 minutes and i can move on to the next item… 4 hours of trying to make this stupid thing work with python 3.7.. i gave up..

I spent 15 hours on it at least and still never got it to pass. I pinged the instructors on piazza but received no response REPLY: the instructions are terrible REPLY: i think the deadline is over now. REPLY: I mostly just wanted to see what I did wrong. I knew it was something stupid. I accepted I missed the deadline, just wanted to figure it out. Thanks James for sharing the post with the formula. Somehow I missed that. I was missing a set of () and it all passed after that *sigh* 
THREAD: How come we can see the answers we chose on the Coursera practice quizzes, but we can't see the answers we chose on the real Coursera quizzes, only the result? I am trying to review for the exam. REPLY: As far as I know, you can not view those options unless you take those quizzes again. The best strategy is to print the webpage before you submit your quiz. Then you can print again to see which ones you got right. This seems like to much work, but it pays off during exam preparation... Otherwise you don't see options for true false or multiple selection questions

THREAD: passed and p-value under 0.05 yay! :grin: REPLY: May I know how many values do you have in text files? REPLY: I saw entry from piazza that P-value should be higher than 0.05.   A small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis.  If I understand correctly, null pypothesis: no difference between two systems.  So now you get value smaller than 0.05, so you reject the null hypothesis. That means that two systems are different. One must be better than the other.  Can someone  tell me if my understanding is correct? REPLY: P-value will differ depending on which parameters you used for your rankers REPLY: see <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=285> for more discussion 
THREAD: on part 2 I'm guessing I should be getting higher MAP for InL2 than BM25? or no? I don't know if I am interpreting this correctly REPLY: As far as I know, BM25 is the best one out there. It's tough to better it with simple known theories I may be completely wrong though.

THREAD: The university and department which I am scraping, none of the faculties have their own website or homepage other than the one listed in the department. Is it ok for MP2 part 1 or should I look for different university/department which has “more information” or “faculty website” content ? REPLY: I ended up switching from my undergrad alma mater to a different school because of that so I could get a sizeable amount of content REPLY: It should be ok if you don't have individual home page for faculty members REPLY: My school has a dept listing page and from there each faculty member (most) have a link to a page that includes their name, contact info, education, biography etc... but that link is within the schools' domain and not a "personal" website or link to their related research group.  So, I'm still getting a distinct URL that I have to get to and scrape from the main directory... but I don't have as many levels of links as some people seem to.  I posted about it on Piazza and most other students (that responded) seemed to think it was ok as long as there is enough data to use for future assignments etc.. REPLY: thanks everyone..

I'm getting stuck as people reported on piazza post 255 (`ranker.score(idx, query, num_results)` hangs), and have been trying to figure out why for an hour without any luck. REPLY: Hey Allie, I had a the same issue too. Are you using python 3.7? It seems to hang in that version. It worked for me when I switched to Python 2 REPLY: Yeah, I am using 3.7, but I saw somewhere in the metapy docs that python 3.x should be supported. I'm trying the EWS route for now... hadn't used it before so didn't have it set up, it seems like kind of a pain, but I started to worry that writing something using Python 2 on a mac might not be compatible with the TA's evaluating it on EWS REPLY: I got EWS set up now though, so guess I'll just stick with that :shrug::skin-tone-2: I thought it must have been some set up thing, like some config got installed in python 2 instead of python 3, but I couldn't find any stack overflow questions to help me, haha :see_no_evil: REPLY: Haha same! There was barely any info on stack overflow. My group mate ran into a similar issue and told me to try out Python 2. I haven't gotten EWS set up, so I might check that out as well REPLY: Apparently Python 3.6.x works as well REPLY: So weird. EWS is definitely NOT very smooth, but at least I know that it'll match what they're using for grading :confused: REPLY: Ok I was able to get it to run on my mac. I had to install 3.6 as above and create a new build system in sublime to use 3.6 REPLY: i also had to install metapy in 3.6 as well, but it ran nicely REPLY: Same... I created a new "cs410" env (Conda) and installed python 3.6.9 and metapy/pytoml.  The script didn't hang this time; but I'm a little afraid to see what else I might have messed up.  :wink: I'm new to using virtual env, but I might be a fan. We'll see.. REPLY: Oh yeah, I see on the MP2 FAQ post on Piazza that Siwei confirmed MeTApy is not compatible with Python 3.7. For some reason I just could not believe that could be possible and it must be some other problem, haha. I feel better now :joy:

Week5 has topic for technology review. But for project proposals we have to wait. you can find more info <https://piazza.com/class/jzkq1yuj1so7ec?cid=113> REPLY: I’d like to know this as well.  It would be helpful to have some general understanding of the scope of the projects and types of methods and tools used so we have some time to consider what projects *might* fit into the guidelines and also be interesting and relevant - vs having to make a quick decision between when the details are released and when our proposal is due (is it week 4?) The details of implementation may change but I would think the “big picture” should be similar to past semesters.   Maybe try asking on the <#C1XHW0MNJ|general> channel where people have taken the class already.  Also there are a few projects “out there” from past terms but not many that I could find.

THREAD: I am confused in "Sort by term-id", are we sorting by  terms at individual document level i.e terms in doc1 will be sorted by term-id within it? Per my understanding this is what should be happening here but I don't see it in this slide because for eg: doc1 id is 1 then why doc1 partition in 2 phase ("Sort by term-id") has 2,4 doc id listed in it? REPLY: The 2nd phase is done on whatever tuples the memory has at that time.  So the collection of  tuples in memory at that time contains the tuple &lt;2,4,3&gt; from document #4 on item #2.  The drawing in the middle is not about partitions corresponding to doc 1, doc 2, .. etc.  This is my understanding. Please correct me if I am wrong. REPLY: that should be sort by term-id in the each individual doc  (e.g, doc1, doc2, doc3… ) so that it’s easier to sort by term id globally ). Ignore those doc id 4 in the middle. It’s just example .

THREAD: Anyone disagree with some of the answers from Quiz 1 (Week 2)?  I'm looking over a couple and am thinking the auto grader may have made an error? REPLY: I felt they were ok. Could you mention the questions specifically? REPLY: Questions 2 and 6.  "Text Engines rely on the text push method" and 6  "The number of outcomes for document ranking and selection are the same".  on 6, I am not sure if I am getting hung up on the definition of "outcome".  Seems like n documents and n outcomes. REPLY: For Q 6 I was making the same mistake but i believe they want to know "All possible out come" which is different then N Document N out come REPLY: for Q6 the number of outcomes for document ranking and selection might not be the same even for a single search. If you search once then ranking will list all documents in decreasing order of relevance. So, for N docs you will always have N results. However, selection will only output the docs it thinks are relevant and ignore the rest. Hence, in this case the number of results you see will be anything between 0 and N. REPLY: and yes the meaning of "outcome" was a little confusing. It is as <@ULYT71VA7> mentioned above. They wanted all possible distinct search outcomes. Imagine you were allowed to search infinite number of times with different input each time. What is the total number of possible distinct search result configurations is what they wanted. REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0> <@ULYT71VA7>  Thank you a bunch for that one.  That outcomes makes no sense to me whatsoever.  In determining relevance, I would have one number, then insert it into a  sorted list, not then compare it to all the others each time.  WHO WOULD DO THAT?????

I only need to finish and submit `example.py` file for my grade by pushing it up to my repo and get passed unit tests thru Gitlab pipelines, right? REPLY: Great! REPLY: I never logged in to EWS until the end of course. All my local macbook pro... REPLY: <@UC2S5SN2Y> do we need to use EWS Machine on any assignments? REPLY: Or course project? REPLY: I believe that was provided for students who doesn’t have a environment for running MetaPy or unix environment... I used mac for all the assignments back in 2018. Cs410 was my first class in this program.  REPLY: Another related question, if not using EWS, but using local windows environment, what terminal can be used for MP?  I tried cygwin and git bash, but I have a lot of issues on installing metapy and pytoml. REPLY: I don’t know.. but if I only have windows machine and dont’ want EWS.. I’d probably running docker on my windows machine and work on it? REPLY: most of assignment for CS410 don’t require IDE level assistance, so any environment should be okay I guess. REPLY: I did MP1 with WSL of Ubuntu 18.04. You can install it from the Windows Store for free. REPLY: There's a Remote - WSL plugin for VS Code that worked really well for me. REPLY: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl> REPLY: On the WSL Ubuntu 18.04 all I needed to do to get my python environment going with python 3 was to execute the following: ``` sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python python-pip sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 20 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 10 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip2 20 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip3 10 sudo update-alternatives --config python sudo update-alternatives --config pip ``` Select the corresponding number for pip3 and python 3 on those last two commands. Then you just use python and pip commands on the system for python3/pip3. REPLY: For GitLab git SSH, I had to generate a RSA SSH key as per this document: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/>  TLDR; ``` ssh-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ``` Then copy the key on the screen and add it to your GitLab SSH Keys under GitLab settings. REPLY: Oh one last thing and I'll shut up. If you use WSL, DO NOT do the "pip install --upgrade pip" command as suggested in the MP instructions. When you do the apt update and apt upgrade, pip is already up-to-date. REPLY: Thank you all for good info. REPLY: I have not been able to get this working - something about unexpected '(' REPLY: gonna see about EWS REPLY: At what point did you get the error? REPLY: Maybe you were trying to execute all the lines in that block above at once rather than one line at a time :thinking_face: REPLY: I don't remember exactly, but I am able to clone/push via ssh 
THREAD: is anyone able to run the "wget -nc <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt>" command on pycharm terminal? REPLY: Are you running pycharm on Linux, Mac or Windows? If you're on Windows, I'm pretty sure it won't work. Just put the URL in your browser to download it then copy it to your working directory. REPLY: Looking at your Piazza post the problem is that you're trying to execute a Linux program, wget, from a python terminal. wget is a Linux command so it is only valid from a Linux terminal (probably a Mac OS terminal too) but not a python terminal. REPLY: <@UJ2HVPHDJ> As mentioned <@UM062HP1V> you can use browser to open *lemur-stopwords.txt* file and copy paste in your local folder with same file name or you can use *Curl* command if using MacBook. On window you can install Git Bash to use Curl command.... REPLY: thank you for the response.. I used wget.download() command and it worked

I'm about to start a project at work analyzing forum data that from a forum A client just bought, so this type of project would be extremely applicable.  I was thinking about working alone on the project, but I would be up for working together.  I'm in Iowa, USA, so the time zone is an hour different.  I have a lot of traditional ML and analytics experience, and some deep learning experience, but not as much software engineering, but I do have a BS in CS, so I'm not completely inept, haha. REPLY: <@UM3Q3KS4E> <@UM8M1EMBN> The project seems quite interesting to me. I’m in the bay area but flexible with the project schedule as I’m on a sabbatical for a few months. My background is in software engineering and I’ve recently completed the Deep Learning Specialization course from <http://deeplearning.ai|deeplearning.ai>. In the course, Sequence Models was challenging and interesting. I would love to work on this kind of topic. REPLY: <@ULXKSNKE0> have you chosen a group? i am in the bay area as well and have taken that course as well REPLY: <@UN2GMNAT1> Sorry, I’ve been off the radar for the past week. I don’t have a group yet. Let me know if you are still looking.

THREAD: Have just completed week2 videos and don't think anywhere L2 distance or Cosine similarity is discussed which is asked in practice quiz REPLY: I agree, this is what frustrated me about the Week 1 quiz REPLY: Just took the quiz.. I think they meant for you to get to the answer based on the equations they provide. Looks like L2 is just the norm whereas the cosine should give you a result that's periodic REPLY: practice quiz* have yet to take the actual quiz. Maybe my frustrations are yet to come :grinning:

THREAD: <@UFDRVCJTG> I recommend you ask that question in Piazza. You’ll get credit for participation. REPLY: good point 
THREAD: If you've finished taking the quiz for week1(not the orientation quiz), can someone help me understand the answer for the question about changing the weights of the bit vector REPLY: I thought it was instead of using bits(0,1) you used frequency of the terms in the vector REPLY: yeah that's what it was, but did the asnwer make sense to you? If so can you walk me through it? REPLY: I already completed it, just looking to understand how that answer is right REPLY: which quiz are you referring to practice or main? Which question? REPLY: What was the question and I can explain? REPLY: Well the question was like you said if we replace the weights with frequency of word instead of just binary 1,0 then will the rank of the list change or not was the question. REPLY: Yes that's what I initially thought that we need to consider frequency of words appearing in document but that's not the case. If you take a close look at the example in videos, for the one having multiple campaign( I think it's doc4) even for that just 1 is considered to calculate weight

THREAD: Btw, I paid for CCA Coursera public class last night and finished up to week2 including quiz, let’s see if I can finish at least CCA part I on Coursera before the semester start so that I can only focus on AML for a while… Coursera said that subscriber can cancel it in two weeks and get full refund but wondering what happens if I just keep going without cancelling. For CS410 they’ve just cancelled my $49 and refund it back automatically iirc and something messed up on their side.. ended up not charging me $149 since I’ve already finished up to week3 or 4 back then. This should be interesting “find-a-bug” for me. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I finished the Part 1 for CCA and got a certificate. I hope the quizzes transfer over. If you are only trying to get ahead on the lectures you can download all of them (I did this so I could watch them while travelling) then drop the course (I did not do this). I assume if you are over charged by coursera you just contact their help desk with a clear explanation of what transpired and they make it right. I currently feel like I was undercharged last semester and still need to reach out to them about this. REPLY: the quizzes should transfer.  You might have to request the transfer though - it is not automatic. REPLY: I remember CS410 and CS425 quiz progress was automatically transferred when semester has started. Automatically means I didn’t ask or request to mcs-ds or mcs-support. REPLY: let’s see how it works lol REPLY: I had to ask on CS410 and it did not happen until about a week and a half into the semester. REPLY: That said, I am not too worried about it. For things like this I imagine it will just work out and I am more interested in focusing on the learning than the administration.

THREAD: what is “Quality Points” mentioned along with the grades and GPA ?  REPLY: Add the quality points and divide by credit hours to get the GPA. I'm not sure why they made it so complicated. REPLY: It's like that so the final GPA can be derived. A 3 credit hour class would count less toward your overall GPA. I've never seen it called quality points, but that's the purpose. REPLY: Where do you see "Quality Points"? I can only see grade letters on StudentInfo page.

REPLY: Email says 2pm tomorrow REPLY: That would be nice. Of course, I'm not convinced that the date instructors are required to have grades submitted is necessarily the same as when we are allowed to see them. REPLY: It would have really helped in bringing peace if they would have released the project grades  REPLY: C- is what I need for company reimbursement, and B- is what uiuc requires for graduating grading. That said, as long as it’s B- or higher I’ll be happy. :) can’t expect A+ due to messed up midterm exam... :( REPLY: Result out?

REPLY: I have a full time job and a toddler btw, so if you have more free time than that, you should be good REPLY: what’ group project in CCA was bugging you? REPLY: <@U8GELQ7KN> I understand that the final project is open-ended, so is the course set up so that you can choose the project early in the semester? REPLY: that's true.  You can also work in groups REPLY: Although you won't necessarily know what cloud technologies to use unless you read ahead or already know.  They are pretty lenient on the grading though, I found.

What I don't have any sense for yet is what AML will be like. REPLY: I would say generally they are similar (lectures,  weekly quizzes, 3 exams, 3 MPs). The project/tech review in 410 was a lot more work, but it was also interesting to try to implement something right away from the lectures. The MPs in 412 are require more programming, but are more informative, in my opinion. 412 drills into some of the algorithms more, but requires less math.

How is it created?  I assume it's a generator.  If you have iterated through that generator before, you can't iterate it again... you need to re-generate the generator... but without the actual code, I'm just guessing here.

I'm trying to find where the official project retirements are now. I remember the wiki with the topic suggestions mentioned that last term had more things required--including a video. Not sure what we need... REPLY: Hmm. Actually it looks like a video may be required, although it sounds like a 5-10 minute voiced PowerPoint would be sufficient. I'm having a hard time making sense of all the things we need to do! REPLY: Do we really need a video or voiced PowerPoint? I thought a comprehensive readme will be sufficient? REPLY: Which is why I spent lots of time on updating readme lately. REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/jky3wzh9mon231?cid=915> REPLY: <@UAQQMLM3J> That answer sounds like, yes, we need a video but it doesn't have to be PowerPoint if it satisfies the objectives. By the way, it sounds like the README could be a significant portion of the project documentation score so that effort wasn't wasted, but the presentation is a separate task.

THREAD: <@U8KEU5RD2>  <@UC4LQG56W> Thank you all for following up my issue. I have sent an email to all the TAs and looping the professor as well. They have taken my issue into consideration and may help me to reschedule a exam session during working hours(Monday-Friday). I think the proctor want to help me to reschedule however as the day was the last day for the exam(they could not select the reschedule date from the dashboard) so they are not able to help me to reschedule directly. They said they would contact our organization(CS410 TAs).  I have asked the TAs to help me extend the exam session so I could pay for the exam2(if needed) and reschedule the exam by myself. :fearful: Next time I would choose an earlier exam session.... :cry: REPLY: It should work out.   I can't imagine they would risk the whole semester efforts of a student because of a small technical issue. REPLY: I faced a similar issue during Exam1 and they rescheduled it and waived off the fee as well. REPLY: Hope it works out and good luck!! It seems that a lot of people have tech issues with proctorU, and I think there should be better guidelines from the university on how to resolve them. (eg. in your situation should you have just paid for a test that day and worked on a refund later?) 
THREAD: ...it is kind of troubling that the system can be so delicate REPLY: exactly...haha... 
THREAD: I could not take the test, please teach me how to reschedule and how to get the refund I have just had a test session at this morning, but due to unknown issue(technical issue: My video freeze every time I connect to the proctor U), the Proctor handover the task to another operator and the operator told me my session ended that I could not take the test.  I started the test on time at 09:40am Singapore time zone which is the time I scheduled. But experienced a technical issue and transfer between the Proctor operator for about 40 minutes. Then they told me my session ended.... :disappointed:  I could not get the refund and could not reschedule the exam.......  Could the TA help me to reschedule the exam as I could not select it from the Proctor even though I want to pay for it again ;(  Or if anyone has the suggestion regarding this issue? REPLY: You can email to Ismini, she will be able to help you for sure.

Granted, it’s a final and I’m just gonna be a little high strung for these things … REPLY: how do you like corvallis? REPLY: my little brother just moved there REPLY: it’s a pretty charming town, I’ve lived here 17 of the last 20 years.  housing market has gotten pretty inflated, but the engineering and cs departments have spun off lots of companies with good opportunities for developers over the last couple decades REPLY: HP has an office there right? REPLY: yeah, I’ve worked there in the past.  currently work for a company that resides in a building on the HP campus REPLY: Yep always close to 20 minutes to start. And I finished this exam in about 15 minutes... REPLY: yay, HP. I work in HP, but never been to Corvallis office REPLY: I worked on webpress software there a few years back 
THREAD: Proctoru and sucks have a syntagmatic relationship for damn sure REPLY: Forgive my frustration venting ... They left me hanging for about 40 minutes.  Every other test has gone smoothly. I think I'm going to just set that notebook aside and use it only for test taking now REPLY: I have a macbook which is pretty much used to surf the web and take proctorU.  The first time I went thru 2 windows laptops before I found the macbook that would work REPLY: I've had a smooth experience with them so far. But, at the end I'm left with the feeling that I'm still being watched. I go through my process list to make sure nothing remains ... still the feeling persists. Think about it.. after the session 'ends' how do you know it has actually ended. Maybe I'm being paranoid :thinking_face:.. but after writing a few Trojans myself, just being lax during the dev phase is enough to let a rogue developer in... and nobody will have a clue. In fact I use a separate cheap windows laptop to take the exam and for almost nothing else. Bit extreme maybe... :face_with_raised_eyebrow:. Sorry, just had to get this out.

THREAD: I just nominated Ismini for the TA awards. For me it seems she really stands out from the crowd. In some other subjects some TAs have been somewhere between invisible and disappointing (to put it politely!), but Ismini seems to work really hard at making this course work for us. If you agree…. <https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/8663423> REPLY: Agree, she deserves it REPLY: I nominated her as well. It was an easy decision as not only is she very helpful but she is very PRESENT. I cannot emphasize that last part enough, she was a near daily presence and that makes all the difference. I can only hope I have an Ismini level TA in future classes, it's seriously a game changer. So far this CS 410 class is the gold standard of my MCSDS experience. CCA was ran ok but content was a little weak. Stat 420 had great content but holy crap it was horribly ran. Like beyond abysmal. It literally had me contemplating applying to a different school because what's the point of paying $2400 to teach it all to myself?! However the CS410 content and excellent support from Ismini has restored some faith! REPLY: hah, I also applied to other universities based on the appallingly amateur experience with AML and CCA in Spring 2018. Got accepted and was about to leave, but the first few weeks of the summer courses were better run (Stat420 started well but became a disaster as you say), and winter has actually been really good, so in the end am glad I stayed. The TAs in my first subject AML were truly awful (with the highly notable exception of the “Amazing Eric”), they even went on strike for a week or so for more money, but no one particularly noticed as they weren’t really supporting students anyway.  Ismini is a world away from those jokers… as is/was Eric. So I think they really deserve some acknowledgement. REPLY: Totally agree. Had no question in my mind when I saw that nomination email. REPLY: +1, I submitted the form as well. Great TAs are really hard to find so I am happy to heap praise on the ones that want to do a great job. REPLY: +1, I also submitted the form. When I saw the email I just had to nominate her right away. REPLY: :heavy_plus_sign::+1:

THREAD: <@UC4SHGAHM> CS425 is considered as one of the best course in this program. But it is challenging in terms of time and efforts. I averaged per week 30+ hours on CS425. Adding 410 + full time job + kids at home =&gt; turned out to be a marathon that I want ended soon! But if you have enough time, I would recommend this course. REPLY: How does one even do that and maintain their sanity?! CS425 on it's own sounds awful! REPLY: It’s definitely stressful. I also fell ill untimely. Ended up taking a week off from work to catch up. Not planning to repeat this feat next semester :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: I imagine your health thanks you for that decision!

But the other homeworks and second MP have been a lot easier. REPLY: Good to know. At least now I know what’s CS425 is going to be in general. :smile: 
THREAD: How was CS425? Was it tough? REPLY: CS425 is a great class; it'll give you plenty of challenge and knowledge.  If you plan on taking it, I would recommend brushing up on Probability/Counting Theory (maybe some differential equations, not necessary though), and BOTH C and C++ programming.  The syllabus and MP instructions say the code is C++, but the style used is more akin to C than C++.  If you've not had an equivalent course to UIUC's CS 241, then I would also recommend reading through the CS 241 course website's materials: <http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/wikibook/home.html>.  That course is an explicit prerequisite and is all in C. REPLY: Thank you

THREAD: <@UC47VMDAB> I have been asking the same question for some time now and mostly the answer is it depends on your background in Math and Computer Science. But one useful metric is AML demands a lot of hours which if you add any other course will make it difficult to manage. After experiencing 425+410 this current semester, I have decided to take only AML in spring semester. REPLY: Thanks this is helpful. I feel AML is vey critical course of entire program. But the way things are setup if i don’t take 2 of them it will push the times lines to 2 years or more. At some point will have to push harder and take 2 courses  REPLY: AML is a hard requirement and probably a core in this program. So I guess we should give it a dedicated semester :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks for the inputs. I am going for doing AML+CCA+DM But after your input I will keep AML+CCA REPLY: No worries!

Almost no math. I spent so much time understanding the math of logistic regression and modeling priors in LDA... definitely useful and good to know but certainly not the core of the exam. REPLY: Phew DONE. I was in a panic too because I could not remember any math from any of the videos. REPLY: TL;DR; it depends on how you are well prepared lol. Seems like prof’s PDF is helpful  + less math formula than exam1 though. REPLY: I didn't make use of anything extra... just went thru most of the videos again @ 2X speed.

THREAD: Is MP3 already over? The implementation I ended up with was pretty close to the tutorial. I tried a ton of other solutions but none of them worked any better. Now I think I should try something a little more unique just to be safe. REPLY: I wouldn’t worry too much.  I had a similar concern.  I asked the TAs.  They’re not grading the MP3 assignment with the same rigor/criteria as the other MPs, since they know we are occupied with the final project and midterm.  The spirit of the assignment was just to experiment. So as long as you’re above the baseline you’ll get full credit. Btw was the business travel for AWS re:invent?   REPLY: This was just Thanksgiving holiday with the family. I haven't been to re:invent yet but it looks like it would be an interesting event to check out sometime. REPLY: I honestly don't know why anyone would do anything above the minimum on mp3. Time spent studying seems much wiser.  The bonus is tiny -pretty likely irrelevant if you understand things well enough to do well in quizzes and exam-  and if you want to play with metapy classifiers why not do it locally with data you know? going through the minutes-long feedback loop throwing different combinations without really understanding the data (or what the LDA variations do) seems like a massive waste of time. REPLY: Agree. The MPs could have been great learning experiences but the implementation feel short.

THREAD: Just to confirm, if I see my name appear above the baseline in the leader board I'm good? I feel uneasy because I only changed one line and I feel like it can't possibly be that easy  REPLY: Correct. it is the same thing as MP1 and MP2.

THREAD: all this randomly generating words from a language model reminds me that given enough time, a monkey can produce Shakespear :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: More than just Shakespeare. Given an infinite amount of time a monkey can produce all books and novels ever produced by humankind. REPLY: There’s not much difference in monkey producing Shakespeare with monkey producing all books in the universe from a human perspective.  :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Ha, just started reading that wikipedia article and it actually states that there: "In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times." REPLY: Yeah, given infinity everything is possible REPLY: Kevin, I think there is a difference between those two statements though REPLY: Kevin, correction: given infinity everything _finite_ is possible REPLY: However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero). REPLY: So.. basically even though it is mathematically possible universe will probably die before this would have occurred. REPLY: The monkey will die first probably :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: lol well.... monkey is a metaphor

THREAD: Eek. I nearly lost a week of notes in a freak copy and paste accident but managed to pull and old copy of the data from OneDrive before the files were able to sync. REPLY: Ouch, maybe turn on file history on Windows of time machine on Mac. Or change to google drive which maintains some sort of history? 
THREAD: You can make 1 particular change to the file and pass.  Will you learn anything. Probably not, but it does get you full points REPLY: I have made many changes ans still struggling. Tried to learn metapy tool and its representation :disappointed: . You meant change the classification algo? REPLY: Yep. The instructions even say just change the make_classifier function  "You will want to change the code in the make_classifier() function in the file classify.py to use a different classifier. You might also want to try changing your feature representation by modifying the [[analyzers]] table array in config.toml." 
THREAD: I felt like MPs are more like a metapy tool test. Am I only one having this feeling.

REPLY: 1542738206: [info]     Cross-validating fold 1/5 (/tmp/pip-req-build-_undjbtw/deps/meta/include/meta/classify/classifier/classifier.h:103) Traceback (most recent call last):   File “classify.py”, line 70, in &lt;module&gt;     make_classifier(fold, inv_idx, fwd_idx), dset, 5) RuntimeError: Unable to cast Python instance to C++ type (compile in debug mode for details) REPLY: your constructor doesn’t take `inv_idx` and `fwd_idx` REPLY: yeah, in this case my make_classifier implementation is just: return Stupifier(training) REPLY: (since the naivebayes it wraps is simple enough  not to require anything else) REPLY: I think it’s because cross_validate is expecting the exact type.  You can run competition.py (just change the config to point to your local config.toml, not /data/cs410/…) REPLY: in competition.py, it directly invokes classifier.classify(…) which does not check for types REPLY: also, if you want to go with this route, `pdb` and `pdbpp` are your friends REPLY: `pip install pdbpp`  &amp;&amp; `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` REPLY: The assignments are borderline pointless but yes you can learn something on your own if you’re motivated and have time to climb the leaderboard  REPLY: bleh, I’ve already wasted enough time on this ridiculous exercise in pointlessness … I just want to hit baseline and get to work on anything else. REPLY: For the new class is it required to implement all the mandatory methods and variables? REPLY: No, only the one actually got called REPLY: has anyone gotten that new class to work?  using EWS machines and environment I get nothing but that C++ error still. REPLY: Did you try directly call `classifier.classify`?  instead of using cross_validate.  My take is that `cross_validate` is a C++ function which only takes the C++ classifier type. REPLY: I didn’t, good call though, I’ll dig into it REPLY: So call make_classifier.classify(dset)? REPLY: Yes REPLY: I am getting this error: AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'classify'

THREAD: Man googling meta toolkit sucks REPLY: haha, give it up :slightly_smiling_face:  even if the term "meta" is more google-friendly, it has close to no useful documentation.  I ended up cloning meta-toolkit C++ source code and just rummaging through the code. REPLY: Yeah I did...heck I wasn't even trying to research for MP3, I was just curious what are some known alternatives and even that was pointless. REPLY: I found a way to use scikit-learn to do this assignment (even though I didn't use it in the end).  They said you can't modify .gitlab-ci.yml to install other dependencies, which is fine, but they didn't say you can't in your classifier module to shell out `pip install scikit-learn` and other modules :wink: REPLY: I've never used scikit-learn, it is similar? REPLY: It's one of the best machine learning packages out there.  It can also do text classification and has much much better community support and documentation. REPLY: I have heard of it but don't know anything about it. I'm completely new to all of this (machine learning, nlp, python, R, etc), a whole new ecosystem to me. REPLY: I'm new to ML and data science in general too.  This course has been eye-opening especially the first half.  The second half feels a bit too dry and abstract and difficult for me to make much practical connection.  MP3 provided _some_ of that practicality. REPLY: Well that's encouraging, I'm about to start it! REPLY: MP3 is easy to pass baseline, but tough to understand some of the metapy functions.  There is basically no documentation on metapy, and the function names are different than C++ meta 
THREAD: I really wish the MP showed some of the clustering results. Just showing a number going up or down doesn't really show me what it is doing. My frustration with the second half of the course is that it explained why things were hard but we never get the chance to see what that means in practice. REPLY: You can download the files and run locally to get more info. REPLY: Ugh. That sounds like work! But I think it would be a good idea to get my hands dirty with some actual clustering/classification tasks to really understand the material. REPLY: I feel same. Some better real world example would help digest better. 
THREAD: For those of you who have done MP3, how time consuming is it? REPLY: Well I spent a lot of time going through both the c++ and python libraries searching for parameters, parameter strings, and what not until I compared them all... hehe REPLY: What is a lot of time? Hours? Days? REPLY: Maybe 1 or 2 hours the first try at it and another 1 or 2 hours last night until I hit a magic sweet spot. REPLY: Oh ok cool, you had me worried for a moment. I was hoping I can bang it out in a night. REPLY: Defintely doable. I had like 8 lines of commented code where I kept track of the scores relative to baseline... The best line at the beginning of starting the assignment ended up being my best line to pass the baseline, but with a few minor adjustments... REPLY: Took me several tries but not that much time - 2h total I'd say. REPLY: I'm just happy to hear it's measured in hours, not days. REPLY: I think I only spent 15 minutes or so of actual work and maybe an hour waiting for pipelines to finish. I *might* spend some more time over Thanksgiving trying to change features and use other algorithms but then again I will probably just leave it as is. REPLY: no therein lies madness REPLY: The 425 MP took me more like 15 hours to get through a very basic implementation, so if you want something a little more challenging... :-) REPLY: <@UC1389H28> 425 sounds like a beatdown but man I bet you learn a ton. Unfortunately I wasted my my cloud breadth requirement on CCA. REPLY: Yeah I put like 4 hours into the 425 MP2 so far, and put some quick(lame because that's where my seg fault is) ring implementation in place so I could work on other parts. I am hoping only another 4 or so more hours to implement the ring and stabalization protocol... MP1 was about 18 hours(2-3 sittings) of work/reading through all the cpp and .h files! REPLY: I felt I spent more time on CS425 MP1, mostly due to fighting with C++ and the weird way MP1 uses C++ (like, use pointer arithmetic to deref a field in a struct, really?) REPLY: Most of my time on MP2 was also spent fighting C++ but we had fewer arguments this time around :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Same here too! I was like just let me get the node id and i'll be good for the rest of the project(5 hours later).... REPLY: Almost like me using an array instead of an unsigned int to hold bit values during my undergraduate studies... hehe REPLY: At least we don't have to debug for memory leaks... lol REPLY: If I had a dime everytime my program segfaults... :stuck_out_tongue: REPLY: I still have all the lectures and quizzes since mid-terms to finish up in 425, but I am done with 410!

REPLY: What’s more frightening is that I got 100% on both week 9 and 10 quiz but I don’t think I understood even half of what he said in the lectures. REPLY: Yeah, I've found the quizzes often don't cover the deeper meaning of the material and tend to focus on some basic ideas. I got a 100% on my second try but a few questions were like "oh, false was wrong so let's try true this time".

THREAD: in Lesson8.9, does `theta` represent *model param* like lambda(as mentioned L8.7) or *topic*? I'm a bit confused REPLY: In 8.9 there is only a single topic and a single document so theta is the topic distribution.  I guess you could say that this corresponds to a model with parameters lambda = ( {theta}, {1.0} ), a single topic that fully covers the single document. REPLY: Thanks <@UC1389H28> I'm still missing something REPLY: In L8.7 - Prob of observed data vs model param (lambda). Optimizing lambda REPLY: In L8.9 - Prob of observed data vs theta ? Here, theta refers the topic or the model params - lambda ( like pi values and k) ? here, are we trying to find the theta which would optimize observed data? REPLY: In 8.7 there are multiple topics, multiple documents, and multiple topics per document. So you are trying to find the lambda which optimizes all of that. So there may be a text mining topic an a travel topic and one document is 90% text mining and 10% travel, etc. All of that information gets packaged up in lambda. In 8.9 it's a simpler case where there is only one topic and one document and that document is only about that topic. In that case, all you need is the topic they since there's only the one. REPLY: Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates are two different ways to determine what "best" means. With maximum likelihood the topic is exactly the word distribution found in the document. I'm actually having trouble wrapping my head around the Bayesian approach. I understand what it does I just don't know how to apply it. I think it might go something like this: you think it's a text mining document and you already have a text mining distribution but the distribution is different so you come up with kind of a compromise. REPLY: thanks, <@UC1389H28> for sharing this detailed explanation. I think your understanding of the 'Bayesian approach' is correct. in L9.4, it is explained well.

THREAD: Isn’t Franch/English/German has same root language? REPLY: It's complicated(tm) lol  English and German are both Germanic so they share a lot of grammatical structures, vocabulary and so on.  French is Romance which is a different language subgroup under Indo-European family and is more in common with other Romance languages like Italian and Spanish.  English and French are only in common insofar as they share a lot of common vocabulary b/c history... the English royal family has French roots for many centuries.  It's like Korean and Japanese have a lot of borrowed words from Chinese but grammar-wise they're totally different. REPLY: lol didn't mean to be controversial REPLY: Lol, it is cool. I was just being funny. You clearly are passionate about the subject REPLY: English is Latin-like and French-like thanks to the Battle of Hastings. To this day, Norman French is still used for ceremonial purposes in the UK Parliament, and the monarch grants royal assent by writing "Le Roi le veult" or (with Elizabeth II) "La Reyne le veult," formally translated as "the King (or Queen) wills it" but less formally as "This is what the King (or Queen) wants." REPLY: The funny thing is that American's are hugely influenced by English history, because it's all written in English. For example, in English history, Napoleon is an evil villain. Most American's share this view, even though he was always very good to the US (he ended the Quasi Wars, erected statues of George Washington, held a huge state ceremony on his death, and sold the US Louisiana for a song.) REPLY: wow that’s something I didn’t know. I guess I need take some american history lecture on Khan Academy if there is any lol

THREAD: So the 5% extra credit, is it 5% on the assignment or 5% for the class?  REPLY: Should be for the class. I remember how it was described how important such extra credits are, which help to jump a grade from A to A+ etc. I am not sure if the extra credit would be a combined score of both MP2 and MP3 REPLY: <@UAPREGE8M> your score in the leaderboard is amazing. I tried a lot to increase the score by tuning params. No idea how you achieved almost 0.5. REPLY: Thanks for kind words. I agree with you, the leader board competition is not easy. Bag-of-words is a blunt instrument for text retrieval.  REPLY: Hopefully it’s for the class. 5% for the assignment is basically worth nothing when it gets tabulated to the class grade.   
THREAD: So I did have issues with super low MAP scores, but then when I committed them, the autograder thought they were fine, and that was resolved with this Piazza post.

THREAD: I interpreted the assignment as basically a test to see who could game the system the best. REPLY: I agree for the most part, but I think as I reached higher, it caused me to start looking into why some of these variables needed different tuning or why they were acting their certain way. I don't think I would have done that by just reading. REPLY: Even the examples that are out there just use OkapiBM25() with nothing else for all their analysis. REPLY: Agreed. Learning to game the system has given me a much better grasp on how the system works.

THREAD: At this point I have to say for MP2 that is there anything other than “luck” and “time to spend to try all the possible combination” until you find that specific magic number when we don’t know what’s data set for apnews that takes 70% of the score AND a few student only tried less than 10 times and still in top position in the leaderboard? lol Even if you know what’s the meaning of those special parameters ( lambda, alpha, etc .. you name it )  Now I’m done done with MP2. REPLY: 1 of them is the TA.  The other I'm not sure. They may be just good at this..  There is more than luck, but it took me a little bit to work out what should be done and how to look at everything. I would say there is more than just luck to get higher on the leaderboard. REPLY: I don’t know, there is a few students who tried less than 10 times but still in top 30 REPLY: I can see now how some people get there. But less than 10 is pretty low.  If you followed all the threads here and converted yourself to NDCG, and saw that you needed the mid 30's to be ranked high. You could do it in one time, but the odds of that are low. REPLY: yeah even that… 
THREAD: Wondering anyone has tried to calculate ndcg score on test data REPLY: You can use *ev.ndcg(results, query_start + query_num, top_k) instead of the ev.avg_p function REPLY: shouldn’t that be divided by number of queries? REPLY: Yes but I wasn't going to give the entire thing.  
THREAD: ok thats very helpful. thanks <@U8GELQ7KN> REPLY: My pleasure. 
THREAD: yeah I guess. How much was that? extra 5% or something? REPLY: do you know it is 5% extra to the programming assignment or to the final course grade? REPLY: it says it’s 5 point on Piazza but I don’t know if it’s 5 point worth base on 100% relevant scoring or literally means 5 points. 
THREAD: I think I got it. I am supposed to replace "ranker = load_ranker(cfg)" in the main with my own ranker REPLY: Nope. Just update load_ranker function to return `InL2Ranker()`  There are internal mechenism which would call `InL2Ranker.score_one()` from main function call where program read query's one by one.  Hope this helps 
THREAD: I think I need to clean out load_ranker and just leave "return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) " there? REPLY: Yes you're correct 
THREAD: i wonder what ranker he's using REPLY: I wrote my own. 
THREAD: anyone tried to calculate NDCG on testing data set locally? can share how can we do that? REPLY: Instead of using ev.avg_p use ev.ndcg

THREAD: I'm down to 128 now. People need to stop trying so hard!!! :-) REPLY: there's only 125 people on that board REPLY: I was looking at the leaderboard that included previous students. I should probably find the filtered version that just compares against current students.

THREAD: However if you haven’t used those PasS stuff (either google cloud or AWS ) or even wore, if you mix those stuff for your project, you’ll end up spending more time to learn and figure out how to use those services/libraries than implementing your project.

THREAD: Can we use T.TEST function in excel for calculating p-value? - for MP2 REPLY: I'm pretty sure you can use whatever you want REPLY: They aren't going to check. REPLY: Cool thanks.. I am getting an exponential value but definitely way less than 0.05.. I understand the concept of p-value but not sure if such a low number is possible or correct...  REPLY: It is possible. It's actually a good thing REPLY: It should be less REPLY: that means they are significantly different REPLY: Cool thanks guys!! REPLY: I got the text from console to create the files REPLY: file looks like Query 10 average precision: 0.20416666666666666 REPLY: should I  remove the text "Query 10 average precision:" and just leave the number REPLY: What should be the value for tail and type for TTEST in excel? REPLY: <@UC6KF2109> Yeah just place the outputs without any text thats in print statement in two columns of excel (one column InL2 and second column BM25 outputs) and then do a T.TEST with type as 1 (meaning paired because both rankers have same number of values) and tails as 2 ( it made sense for me to use two tailed distribution).. REPLY: got it.. txs REPLY: My TTEST values came to 0.4745 REPLY: my bad REPLY: made a minor mistake in the code.. all sorted now.. txs for the help 
THREAD: <https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/tutorials/5-topic-modeling.ipynb> REPLY: Explanation?

Don't click on the text, go straight to the Link and Github will convert it for you to something you can read. REPLY: <@UCAF53F2L> So, I went through the document, I'm not sure what it will try to help with. REPLY: maybe MP3? REPLY: It’s a jupyter notebook script. REPLY: It looks like using a model to extract topics and based on the topics to score terms. I think it could be referred to and may have a better score REPLY: I have’t tried, and I don’t think I’d have time to explore using a topic model to implement a ranker, but it think it’s worth trying. REPLY: or I could be totally wrong 
THREAD: In the Statistical significance testing part, we need to save the output in the " bm25.avg_p.txt." file ? REPLY: Is this part optional ?

REPLY: we can write our own script, that was just an example of how to do it in R 
THREAD: I saw my name on leaderboard. it means "passing the baseline on the leaderboard" ? Or, I need to got better ranking ? REPLY: There is a set baseline on the leaderboard. Your rank should be above the baseline for passing. REPLY: There is a specific row in the table, colored green and with the name "Baseline". You need to be ranked above this row REPLY: 298	Baseline	0.3702	-inf	0.3461	-inf	0.3806	-inf	2017-03-02 | 01:03:25	1  is this one ? yes. I above REPLY: do I need to get better ranking even though I above this line. REPLY: No, you only need a better ranking if you want to go for bonus marks by finishing higher on the leader board REPLY: thanks

THREAD: Just finished the exam.  Didn't get 100% but I'm happy with the score.  The exam was quite fair with 2-3 "trickier" questions.  Now onto cs425 which is more worrisome lol REPLY: All the best :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Good luck! REPLY: Thanks! REPLY: Good luck! 
THREAD: Is MP2 due tomorrow?  REPLY: No. It was posted on Piazza. It's been set for the 21st REPLY: You scared me dude :joy:  REPLY: Thanks! Lol I was scared for a bit as I dint see that post. 
THREAD: of course I was wrong in assuming that! Nevertheless, I’m happy at least I passed REPLY: exactly same feel i got REPLY: Me too ! :grin: 
THREAD: Me too! So nervous :exploding_head: REPLY: don't worry. it's not hard (I studied 1.5 days, missed one q). Just make two or three passes on the questions. IMO that's the one key skill: not submitting to quickly :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: Done with mid term for CS410 now time to prepare for CS425. REPLY: Me too. Frankly i think cs425's will be easier because half of the topics have been beaten to death in homeworks and mps. I think that's the one downside of the really easy mps on cs410. REPLY: I’m still nervous on getting asked something complex with a very limited time on hand. I spent multiple weekends on each HW, no way I can solve those complex questions in 90 mins. Especially on how tedious it is to mark timestamps on process flow and the amount of calculations a problem can have. 
THREAD: Finally done with my exam. Some questions were a bit tricky and I had to take a 2nd look at it to make sure I understood it correctly, but I guess I managed to somehow understand the gist of the question. REPLY: What score did you get? REPLY: (if you don't mind my asking) REPLY: i managed to get 100% :slightly_smiling_face: Guess a bit of luck was on my side too! REPLY: Congrats. I think I psyched myself out of the correct answers for a few questions because I felt like I really knew the material going in. REPLY: Congrats! That's terrific. REPLY: I missed one, but I agree Shrikant, the 2nd and 3rd look are the keys to these tricky multiple-choice exams. REPLY: I recognized a few trick questions but then I started wondering if they were double-trick questions. Multiple choice and true/false questions don't leave any room for subtlety or explaining you're reasoning. 
THREAD: Created poll for the score range REPLY: That has overlapping values for the 10 marks -- since the exam had 20 questions, there's a strong likelihood that a lot of people got 70, 80, and 90%. Can you remake it with one that has exact boundaries? REPLY: I can not edit poll :( 
THREAD: Done with exam finally REPLY: how’d it go. guna take mine soon, nervous but tired… REPLY: It was ok...could have been better....dont worry it will be fine REPLY: thanks :blush: REPLY: I’m taking it in 2 hours. Now am not feeling good about the above comments from Aditya! REPLY: <@UAKLSUM4M> don't worry i think you'll be ok.. i guess i just underestimated it a bit.. make sure to brush up on concepts rather than specific problems.. :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: Thanks! I hope it goes well. REPLY: It wasn't that bad IMO 
THREAD: wow.. that exam sucked.. i feel that the quizzes absolutely don't represent the depth of knowledge required in some topics to give that exam.. REPLY: I agree. I studied a lot learned the concepts very well.  I develop test for a living. In my opinion, I don't think this was a good measure of my grasp of the concepts. I did not do very well on the test. On the bright side, I know the material very well now. Onward to putting energy into getting point via other methods. 
THREAD: it's the floor of log base 2, you dont need to remember the whole log table REPLY: yeah, that won’t be too much to remember if the question has low value of x.. something within 10 
THREAD: are we suppose to remember log table for gamma code questions? I see calculator is not allowed. REPLY: log base 2 with floor can be calculated easily . using powers of 2. REPLY: for 2 its 2^1 so 1 for 3 its 2^1 so still 1 for 4 its 2^2 so 2 for 5 2^2 its 2 similarly you can calculate REPLY: thanks! REPLY: all the best for the exam :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: Thanks for the info on which classes are difficult! Very informative. REPLY: I want which courses are more useful over others.. or maybe which materials are more prepared well for online course than others lol REPLY: Stat 420 was suppose to be really good.. Last semester wasn’t so good.  REPLY: CS425 is suppose to be really good.  REPLY: DataViz was pretty interesting and pretty organized and smooth.  CCA is outdated. Stat420 like I said is suppose to be good. Just wasn’t this past semester REPLY: I found STAT420 to be really good from the content perspective but really horrible from execution perspective (at least Summer 2018). Maybe I am an outlier but I found DataViz ridiculously easy and not that useful. :face_with_rolling_eyes: REPLY: For me it was my first class, and I never used Tableau before.  So it was good to see other methods of visualizing data.. I think that is one area where probably lots of people need help..  REPLY: Stat 420 was a shit show in Summer 2018, apparently it was really good before that. Hopefully that was an outlier and not the new norm. REPLY: I didn’t find the dataviz lecture content that great but I loved learning d3 and really enjoyed the final project  REPLY: Other than R Studio stuff, I've done zero data visualization, I assume someone like myself would learn a lot in DataViz ? REPLY: Yes though depends on how much you put into the assignment  REPLY: Yeah, JTinAZ: I've done 0 data visualization as well but I can tell you it took me maybe 8 hours to do a midterm project. But final was a bit rougher with learning d3 and all. The problem is we didn't really get much content, no one taught us d3. We were taught some basic fundamentals and then you're on your own roaming around internet trying to understand how it all works. REPLY: Whereas STAT420 lectures were super informative. But as you said it was a shit show otherwise. REPLY: For me data cleaning was the easiest (and least useful), and AML (poorly run) and ABM (well run) the hardest by a margin. stat 420 wasn’t that hard but poorly run (last time) and high workload. CCA was reasonably easy but shallow  (and also run poorly). PSL is easier than expected (so far) but still not that easy, and well run considering it’s the first time. Text info sys is mid range difficult and effort (and well run so far ) REPLY: I had so much expectation for AML and a bit sad that it ran poorly… REPLY: Thanks for the info on which classes are difficult! Very informative. REPLY: grahamc2, you think STAT420 was easier than Text Info Sys? That definitely tells me how different people are :grin: REPLY: It all depends on people’s background I guess lol REPLY: I took Data Viz over the summer. Loved it. With Text Info Systems, the lectures are very good, but they keep having technical problems and most of the major deadlines have been moved, which makes it difficult  to keep track of what's due when. Also, the extra credit for participating in the Piazza forum is frustrating. It basically rewards people for doing the lectures early. If you do them (say) midweek, then almost all of the questions are already answered for that week's lectures. REPLY: I am taking CS 498 Applied Machine Learning in the Spring. Sounds like I'm in for a lot of hard work and disappointment. REPLY: Some people said AML is good but it’s poorly executed. Also for extra credit, we don’t know who’s gonna take that credit. I’ve answered many question by myself but only one or two are marked as “good question” by instructor. So I’d rather spend those time for focusing more in materials or for mid/final term than extra score that you don’t even know what’s the current status of me lol

THREAD: is there a pass percentage for the exam.. Do we have to take answer like 80% of questions correctly? something like that?

THREAD: “Sub linear transformation is needed to capture the intuition of ‘diminishing return’ from higher TF.” Can anyone please help me understand what that means ?  REPLY: Sub linear transformations e.g. logarithm =&gt; if you take the derivative of ln(x) for example (not sure we use the natural logarithm tho!) =&gt; the derivative is 1/x. This means for a small change in x, ln(x) changes by 1/x, which is decreasing as x increases. Therefore, we have diminishing impact as x increases.

THREAD: it's binary with an added number of some value to the end of it right? REPLY: 9  1 + floor(log(x)) =  1 + 3  = 4 unary prefix  1110  x - 2^floor(log(x)) = 9 - 8 = 1  in floor(log(x)) = 3 bits  001  so gamma coding: 1110001 REPLY: for quick gamma, i found it useful to check from floor(log2(2)) to floor(log2(8)): it’ll boil down to 1,2,3. REPLY: than the transformation in unary of the value + 1 REPLY: then you’ll add the rest until you reach the soil of the next log...

THREAD: Are you guys bothering with memorizing the formulas for the exam? REPLY: I’m not. Focusing more on the content as there are plenty of libraries that do all the formulas for us.  I think the basic understanding of how the functions work and why they are different is where I’m spending most of my time.  REPLY: I'm not but I am trying to make a mental note of the parameters that control them. E.g. Rocchio Feedback - alpha controls the original query vector, beta controls the positive centroid vector and gamma controls the negative centroid vector REPLY: Well assuming I'm understanding Rocchio Feedback properly anyway REPLY: That's sorta what I am trying to do too REPLY: I've been relying heavily on the videos and lecture slides but whenever there's something that's not quite clicking I check out the book, it often does a great job of bridging the understanding gap that sometimes happens from watching the videos only. REPLY: yeah I found that reading book is really helpful… as it doesn’t have subtitle typo and I can control the tempo as well. And it’s better organized than in the video. You already took prof Zhai’s video so when you read it you can hear his voice lol

THREAD: metapy has the framework which can be used to drop stopwords.. but need to supply it a custom list of tokens a user wants to drop. There is an example of that in MP1  wget -nc <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt>  tok = metapy.analyzers.ListFilter(tok, “lemur-stopwords.txt”, metapy.analyzers.ListFilter.Type.Reject) tok.set_content(doc.content()) tokens = [token for token in tok] print(tokens) REPLY: Hmm that’s a bit different than what <@UAS9UN7DM> mentioned above.  Does the config.toml handle it already. I guess I can test it.  REPLY: Think it should be possible to do using .toml too, my understanding of that configuration is , it is markup representation of the runtime &amp; features available in library. Any meta toolkit API a user can use in through python, should also be available through markup. REPLY: I’m 90% sure MP2 is already removing those stop words by configuration, but you can test it by simply removing those stop-word configuration and see if result became different I guess REPLY: Yes, for MP2, in the config.toml, there is an explicit attribute for stopwords: stop-words = “stopwords.txt” REPLY: Confirm that it is taken into account: I have added dummy words from the corpus to see how it affects the rating and it indeed has an influence. REPLY: Also, tried (not too intensively) to change the default filter-chain, without improvement on overall score for now :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: your previous comment got me excited to experiment with a limited list of stopwords and see how it impacts ndcg on evaluation and test set but looks like not  much :slightly_smiling_face: REPLY: well you can still touch those stopword to improve your ndcg@10 if that works REPLY: “Also, you are free to edit all files except:   .gitlab-ci.yml timeout.py competition.py” REPLY: so why not lol 
THREAD: I feel like I don't understand what making our own InL2 ranker really means.  I changed the code and added the right math function. I"m above the baseline so that's good, but is that it.. Not sure how to really improve it. REPLY: Should we improve the InL2 for leader board or we can user other ranking function to go up in leader board ? REPLY: I completed InL2 and I found another ranking function with parameters which I can use to do better in leader board REPLY: I'm not sure. REPLY: You can use whichever ranking function you want for the leader board - doesn't have to be InL2. I didn't use InL2

THREAD: I've got my exam scheduled for after work tomorrow but I've still got my CS 425 homework to finish so my study time will be...limited. Two midterms, a homework set, and then right into tech review and project proposals. This is going to be a fun week?!? Good luck everyone! REPLY: On the same boat with 425+410.. Luckily finished my homework yesterday. Now all remains is prep for 2 exams &amp; tech review/project proposal. All the best! REPLY: I wish someone would have told me how consuming is CS425, would not have taking anything else with it! REPLY: Same here... It's been "fun" couple of weeks. REPLY: I can’t claim that since several folks sounded alarm during first couple weeks on slack and a few dropped 425 as well. I should have taken it seriously :) Any ways, I have cancelled all the family events for next 2 months and am planning to take a week off before final exams to cleanup the backlogs.  REPLY: Yeah, I didn't take the warnings seriously enough either! There's no way I'm getting the Quiz 6 and Coursera Exam 1 taken before the midterm, so it's a good thing they aren't due until December (but that means I'm lacking study material going into the midterm). REPLY: I’m in the same dilemma.. perhaps we should create a separate channel (425+410) to lend each other shoulders to cry.. :cry: 
THREAD: “Note that the usefulness of the tool is an important grading factor, so make sure that you invest your effort on developing a really useful tool.” ugh … what are the odds that this assignment will yield “really useful” tools?

THREAD: Guys do you know what is K1 and K3 in BM25 ?  I guess K1 is related to the TF transform part. ie `(k+1)x/(x+k)` and K3 is related to the IDF part ie. `log(M+1/K)`. in that case, k1 varies from 0 to 1 and the upper bound of K3 would be M. but according to the slide, K1, and K3 varies from 0 to inf. Not sure wht I'm missing here. REPLY: I believe your understanding is correct. Many descriptions of BM25 have something to the effect of `experiments have shown reasonable values are to set k_1 and k_3 to a value between 1.2 and 2 and b = 0.75. ` <https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/okapi-bm25-a-non-binary-model-1.html> I believe that only `b` is bound to 0 to 1. Help me understand which part make is look like k_1 would also be bound this way? REPLY: thanks <@UC4SXMPF1>. I checked the material again and realized that K can be large if we want to consider linear TF transform. I should have checked it earlier. srry. May be I was thinkin about `b` instead of k. 
THREAD: hey guys, can someone share some details on the workload for this course? I am trying to select a course for Spring. I have a few releases coming in up in Spring and expect limited time for coursework. I am familiar with Python but not an expert. It will be very helpful if you can help me understand the time commitment for CS-410 and expected skill level with Python and any other required tool/language.

THREAD: you need to git submit only that file. REPLY: Thanks.  I have two questions: REPLY: 1)  By "git submit" do you mean we just upload it to the base directory of our project repository? REPLY: 2)  For lnL2, do we need to actually be running it in the final search_eval.py file we put in the repo?  This is where I'm getting confused. REPLY: I assume no, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to run anything else for the leaderboard. REPLY: 1) yes you need to stage the file by git add and then git commit REPLY: and then 2) you can run it in your local to see the number and submit the code so that pipeline kicks in and your alias (name ) shows up in leaderboard REPLY: you need to run your InL2 impl in your local anyway to get p-value 
THREAD: tech review submission due date is coming! REPLY: Don't worry it's only "Tech Review Topic Proposal" REPLY: yeah even that.. I have no idea so far lol 
THREAD: Whatever alias you set for mp2 will show up.  REPLY: Ya but my confusion was on what ranker to use at the end of this to reflect on the leaderboard. Is it my choice to use metapy or InL2? The grading says both pipelines have to pass. I ran the metapy ranker first commented it and then ran the Inl2 ranker. Is that correct? REPLY: that p-value is based on your InL2 implementation. They want to see the value and see if your implementation was correct or not ( or myabe close to ) compare to BM25. So end result will be 1) you submitted a file with p-value which is created by BM25 and InL2 impl and 2) your name(or alias) above the baseline of the leaderboard REPLY: 3) you get extra if you are top % of the scoreboard I guess REPLY: Thank you. This is helpful!

Auto grader / server / pipeline won't know it. REPLY: If you do not push commit, you will not see CI/CD pipeline trigger the tests &amp; hence no "passed" status.

THREAD: I thought Tech review is an individual task REPLY: I thought Tech review is an individual task REPLY: tech review is individual task and it won’t be included in your grade. REPLY: I read the following about tech review in the Week 4 material: Working in a team is allowed for finishing the Technology Review; indeed, to the extent we can, we would attempt to compile all the submitted reviews into multiple handbooks to be made publicly available on the Web (e.g., “Handbook of Text Data Applications,” “Handbook of Software Toolkits for Text Retrieval and Analysis,” “Handbook of Emerging Techniques for Text Retrieval and Analysis”). However, to avoid complication in the coordination of team work, the size of a team should in general be no more than 3 members, but larger teams are also possible subject to the approval of the instructor. When working in a team, each team member must make substantial contributions to a review (i.e., must have written at least 1000 words). This means that a review produced by a team of 3 team members is expected to be much longer than a review produced by a single-student team. A review written by a team with more than one member must include a brief description of contribution of each individual member. REPLY: Also looks like it is going to be graded? The Technology Review will be graded based on completion of the following two tasks:  1. Topic proposal: Every student is required to select a topic from a provided topic list or propose a topic at Week 6, which is the time when the project proposals are due so the students can align the topic of the Technology Review with that of the course project. Students can work as a team to finish a Technology Review. In general, the size of the team should be no more than 3 members, but larger team is possible subject to the approval of the instructor.  2. Review submission: Each team is required to submit a complete Technology Review at Week 14. This deadline is set to an earlier time than that of course project code submission so as to give the students an opportunity to read some relevant reviews (especially those on toolkits) before finishing their projects if they want to. Details about how to submit the review will be posted later. REPLY: it will be graded based on your “completion”, so it’s just metric component. There is mention in week1 tech review section REPLY: “As I said, the technology review is not actually contributing to you grade, but it’s a metric component and it will be graded based on completion.” I am also interested in learning about resources we can use to do our tech review.

THREAD: Sure it’s good enough, and Spyder is OK, but Pycharm is a much better IDE, and VScode is a much better editor (also sublime text, and atom) - all of these are much more popular in industry than Spyder. Also Jupyter notebooks (supporting Python and R - and some other) are excellent , extremely popular in industry, and well worth learning. In summary, if you have to learn Spyder then I’d consider learning something else that you may get more use of later on. Or if you already know VI/VIM thats also decent, general purpose and very commonly used REPLY: Ok makes sense. I installed pycharm and was trying to update pip but its says pip version 18 already exists but its still using version 10. Got very confused and switched to Spyder. I will give it another shot. Thanks! 
THREAD: Just s thought but unless you’re planning a fair bit of complex python development pycharm is a lot to learn, and an editor like ms vscode might be a lighter weight option. Vscode now ships with anaconda as the default editing environment, and has syntax and autocomplete for most languages in this course, ie Java, c++, html, css, javascript, bash etc and of course python, so you don’t have to learn a new environment for each language. Anyway everyone has their preferences and there’s pros and cons of editors vs IDEs, but it’s definitely an option worth considering. REPLY: I love VS Code, it's become my go to editor these days.

You must follow the initialization, normalization and iteration procedure specified in this reference (refer to page 403). You can use the sample test cases to debug your code, however the final test case is significantly larger and hence may require an efficient implementation. You must keep this in mind when you make your submission. REPLY: Never mind!

THREAD: Ugh. Taking those ProctorU exams is the thing I'm most dreading about these courses. REPLY: Why is that?  REPLY: They're really pretty convenient REPLY: I've had zero problems with them.  They have been easy to deal with especially once you figure out what they are looking for to do their job. REPLY: I'm sure it will be fine, it's just all the rules of where you can be, what you can have, and things out of your control like whether WiFi will go down in the middle of the exam... REPLY: If you schedule an exam at say 10am, be prepared to not actually start said exam until 10:30 or later. I've only taken 3 but all 3 took at least 30 minutes before all the issues were ironed out and I was allowed to start on the exam. Other then that it was fairly painless. REPLY: Basically, clean off your desk area. Have something like a mirror or your phone (unless using a webcam that can be moved) to show the proctors that you don't have answers written somewhere and you are not cheating.  If WIFI goes down, connect with them immediately and let them know and they will do their best to get you started again or they will reach out to the instructor to let them know.  That is all there is really to it.   They are there to ensure that the exam is given in the same sort of measured environment that someone on-premise would be receiving.

THREAD: hi all, is anyone else struggling with grasping certain concepts in this course. I don't know why but the info just isnt sticking like prior classes I've taken thus far? Mostly just want to know I'm not alone here haha REPLY: Sorry man you're all alone REPLY: Just kidding ... part of why I dropped 425 was to focus on 410 - I really want to understand the concepts and applications, rather than just rushing through things superficially REPLY: Im also struggling a little bit...well see how i do for mp1 REPLY: I am in the same boat and made a post on Piazza that said the same.  I'm looking for something more concrete instead of theory. I need to see this stuff work to really get it.

THREAD: It looks like chapter 6 of the textbook covers the vector space model and statistical language models using the same motivating examples and diagrams as the lectures. So if you felt like the formulas flew by too fast to understand (I know I did), this might be a good way to dig deeper into the derivations. REPLY: Nice. I’ll definitely check it later.

THREAD: Anyone has his/her all-inclusive Coursera account automatically being discontinued after starting this course? REPLY: the monthly ~$50 one? I can still use mine for other courses. REPLY: When course ha started, Coursera cancelled the existing subscription(49.99/mo), and those will be moved to your $158 for Courser fee.  REPLY: For some reason they decide to move it to your $158 and that’s all? I asked mcs-support for why I’m not ask to pay Coursera fee for first quiz submit, and that’s what they explained to me.  REPLY: I still don’t know if that means they’ll extra charge $158 - $49.99 or my previous $49.99 is going to cover all the $158. Seems like it should be the first case, but what’s actually happening is 2nd case?? Maybe they have so technical difficulties to solve this issue.  REPLY: Historically, I’ve had to pay both separately.  
THREAD: but this class has not charged me yet REPLY: I can't even submit quiz without paying REPLY: I took Data Visualization course didn't charge me money REPLY: that's strange... did you contact the coursera? <https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us> REPLY: I did but no reply REPLY: Same here, have taken the quizzes through week 2 but still no prompt to pay.

There has not been a single class (this is my 4th) that Piazza wasn't essential and the primary way of communicating with other students as well as instructors.. REPLY: Also, Piazza I would say is probably more ASYNC than slack is so. REPLY: But it really isn't going to matter. No one searches in Slack or Piazza for previous discussions. They just post and run.

Sadly, I'm on Windows 10 (my Ubuntu laptop magically died prematurely), so, just based on a quick Google search, I guess I couldn't use DevonThink, but it sounds really useful...

The description leads me to believe that we need to look up academic papers and cite previous research but on the other hand, my topic proposal (comparing two different python web scrapers) was approved even though it has probably been covered a million times which makes me think this should be a more informal exercise. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this? REPLY: I have similar question - I wish there was a bit more information on the expectations for the assignment. REPLY: Don’t overthink it. I am planning on a review based on commercial offering and maybe a paper.  REPLY: From previous courses I saw paper-like tech reviews REPLY: This is a on-completion task.

THREAD: I am curious to hear from anyone else who has taken some other courses in this program, but so far I have felt the CS410 has been basically worthless in terms of providing any real world skills.  I am wondering if this is an outlier or if most of the program is the same way? REPLY: I don't agree that it's been *completely* worthless, but I agree with the general sentiment that it's been a lower value class. I think the content and topics are worthwile, but the presentation has been a bit disorganized. I have a math background and feel quite comfortable with formula-based definitions, but on review I find that the slides often don't formally introduce the variables which makes it harder to follow. I've also found the lack of feedback and description of what's expected for the project and technology reviews to be very distracting. I understand that they are intended to be open-ended and up for interpretation, and perhaps I should be more proactive specifically *seeking* feedback or clarification, but overall it has made the course feel somewhat disorganized. The one other class I've taken so far in the program, Data Visualization, felt much better organized overall. REPLY: I would agree probably not "completely", but I will say that as the first course I have taken as part of this program I am highly disappointed so far.  I have also felt like the programming assignments are very odd/not representative of how you would approach these problems in the real world.  And don't get me started on Metapy.... REPLY: Yeah, they haven't been very representative of how things have worked so far in the industry, at least from my perspective. REPLY: I feel instead of quizzes, every week should have an assignment that reflects the content of the week with a direct correlation of what was learnt with the assignment REPLY: Quizzes are never a learning tool..atleast not the way it has been executed in all the MCSDS courses I have taken so far REPLY: CS-425 is the only exception.(assuming you have access to the classroom lectures) REPLY: Here's my two cents:  1. if people came into 410 with the expectation of getting practical experiences on an industry standard toolkit (ie: NLTK) then they are going to be disappointed. if they want a theoretical overview though they'd be pretty happy with the content.  2. I wish the programming assignments are more involved and doesn't just require two simple calls to some black box functions. Also metapy documentations could use some serious work. Personally, I'd rather have some tutorials teaching us the actual code and structure of the underlying MeTA toolkit (which does have something that at least has some semblance to a documented API) in C++ instead of using a poorly documented Python wrapper aka metapy just because it's Python. REPLY: I’m going to go against the grain here and say that this class has personally been useful in providing knowledge related to real-world applications. I am currently working on a project in R&amp;D phase that deals with text data and while I do have previous experience working with this type of data, the class has provided a lot of theoretical knowledge that I had been lacking resulting in more informed approaches to problems that come up.  I do agree with the sentiment that the programming assignments are lacking, however. MeTA seems like a good idea but the documentation is just really awful. REPLY: I do have to say that CS-410 Coursera lectures are way better  than the CS-412 lectures. REPLY: I expected to learn about core basics of text retrieval and analytics and this course exceeded my expectations. Once you have good grasp of basics, you will find the right library for your needs in the real world  REPLY: I give this course 8/10 - MP assignments could be made better REPLY: I'm in the minority here, but I have found this class useful. I appreciate the theoretical approach to determining page rank and probabilistic models, as well as how the instructor defined formulas for things like TF/IDF normalization and justified their importance.    As a software guy, I find this high level "conceptual" teaching important because I feel that I'll be able to very easily pick up the practical experience with toolkits, etc myself.  Reading API docs is the easy part.... REPLY: I felt the same way about CS425, so expect more of the same if you're taking that class at a later date.    My two favorite classes so far. REPLY: I'd still rank 425 to be the better of the two though. I found it to be more interesting and rigorous, especially the assignments. REPLY: Agreed. REPLY: I disagree about the quizzes:  I feel they are *v* important for verifying the learning.  The lectures are good quality. 
THREAD: Has anyone received feedback for the project proposal or tech review? REPLY: No not yet 
THREAD: Anyone having true with the setting up the pipeline step? REPLY: Those instructions on Coursera are outdated. He menu changes probably came with a new version change of Gitlab. 
THREAD: MP3 is available now: <https://gitlab.textdata.org/cs410-fa17/MP3> REPLY: Any info on new deadline for MP3? 
THREAD: Have you taken the class on coursera in MOOC form before? If you have and completed quizzes, those grades are transferred over to the class. You still have two quiz attempts to improve the score REPLY: ur correct - I was like "hey - i have seen syntagmatic relationship  content before  - why is it repeated?" 
THREAD: Hey guys, if someone is still looking for a teammate for project please let me know REPLY: What are you interested in doing? REPLY: I am looking into Topic Modeling - and am undecided as to a teammate. Let me know if you have some ideas on that "topic". REPLY: I have been surveying papers on TM and have not yet narrowed down the specific area. I had considered things like "TM using TensorFlow"  and "TM on Wikipedia". Both are not quite good fits for the scope: so am still looking for the right focus.  If you want to discuss further open up a private channel. REPLY: Hey <@U5B64N5GC> Topic modeling is something I want to incorporate as a part of my project <https://piazza.com/class/j6h1gozq5xh14z?cid=399> I am working alone right now, but am open to new people if the interests align.. 
THREAD: what do you mean “pointed to a ranker”. it should be done by updating load_ranker REPLY: I am wondering about the relationship of the `score_one` to the InL2 formula:  which portion of the formula is that correspond to? REPLY: ok there seems to be a discussion REPLY: <https://piazza.com/class/j6h1gozq5xh14z?cid=438> 
THREAD: alright thanks vicotr REPLY: Hi Varun - one confusion I had was about how to apply a `score_one` to the given formula: and how/where the `c` applies. I'll get back if i get more 'light' on that 
THREAD: Hi  - it appears that I will be working alone on the project. However I would anyways appreciate some collaboration : sharing ideas is good!   What I'm looking for is another person (or two) that are  also working on their own: but we can help each other out by bouncing ideas and giving critiques. So we *continue to pursue our separate work* but gain some of the benefits of teamwork.   Interested? Pls post to a side thread off of this one . Thanks. REPLY: Hi predict I am interested REPLY: I will be working on a recommend system like netflix for movies REPLY: hi I forgot how the course will appear in Cousera ? REPLY: I registered for database systems REPLY: in self service portal 
THREAD: <@U5D824BQU> I posted a reply to one of your responses in Piazza, but you may not have seen it...I was wondering where you found the function names for the ranking functions (DirichletPrior(), OkapiBM25(), et al) because when I browsed through the API, all I could find were "pythonized" versions (i.e. dirichlet_prior, okapi_bm25, etc)... REPLY: @ryan , I just did  print (dir(metapy.index))  to find this . It's an easy way to find the supported methods and attributes of a class  REPLY: <@U57R64BGT> What a handy trick!  Thanks so much for sharing :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: I just send email  <mailto:mcsds-support@illinois.edu|mcsds-support@illinois.edu> REPLY: Hi <@U5B4BNVDK> - I see your support ticket at <mailto:mcsds-support@illinois.edu|mcsds-support@illinois.edu>. My team will get you step by step instructions shortly. Thank you for your patience over the weekend :slightly_smiling_face: 
THREAD: it seems also that MeTA has a greater functionality for text _retrieval_ methods than nltk (I could be wrong I'm really not that familiar with nltk) REPLY: Agreed:  this course is about both mining and retrieval - and the MeTA cares about both. 
THREAD: <@U21L8AFNE> seems that you are behind a proxy server and your proxy is refusing connection to the pypi repository REPLY: thanks it must be my work blocking the proxy server REPLY: Yes if you still want a hack that out try finding a mirror which your proxy allows and then provide the index like  Pip install --index url metapy REPLY: i'll give it a try at my home computer later tonight REPLY: :+1::skin-tone-2: 
THREAD: People have a preference and are voicing it. "Aww man" is far from freaking out and to call it as such is an overreaction. REPLY: I really don't see anyone freaking out. REPLY: ok i apologize for my poor use of the word then i think nramaker  and my point still stands REPLY: Your "point" is apparently that the effort invested in the coding does not need to be useful for industry.  Ok - that is your opinion. Mine was that "why *not* make it more useful outside of the class". REPLY: Uh no? My point is the class is focused on core concepts not constructing elaborate projects that require you to link 30 different libraries on very specific setups. So if you invest the effort to gain a deep understanding of said concepts with a particular tool you should be able to spend a bit more effort to implement said concepts using whatever other tools of your choosing. Not to mention python is designed with ease of use in mind in the first place. REPLY: If the class was taught in python and now all of a sudden they decided to switch to c++, i'd say yeah that would be a strange move because they essentially decided to redo their infrastructure to introduce unnecessary overhead like learning how to compile cpp source properly. however it was already in c++ to begin with. if they want to switch to python, ok great. if they don't, well so be it nothing stops me from learning nltk on my own. REPLY: 30 different libraries ? well ok if that's what you think were involved in nltk.  Actually that *is* the case for *some* deep learning libraries: but not *this* library. REPLY: ? That is not what I said at all. I said the class *isn't* about complex projects that have a lot of external dependencies. It's about NLP concepts that are essentially language neutral. Nothing about NLTK man. 
THREAD: This is exactly what i mean. It's not like python is a difficult language to use. At the level we are working at if one really wants to learn to use nltk he should be able to go the extra mile and reproduce whatever he did in MeTA using nltk pretty easily (unless he used  features in MeTA thats missing from nltk of course) REPLY: This is exactly what i mean.

THREAD: It's like complaining about the type of hammer chosen in a demonstration about how nails work.

THREAD: <@U6JFXD7DG>  I think if you click on the Grades page it indicates the specific date that each assignment is due REPLY: It looks like that page is missing some assignments  
THREAD: <@U6JFF8TA9> Yes. I would assume everyone in the class probably received that email. The link is at the bottom "Join live event via <http://Zoom.us|Zoom.us>" REPLY: ah that works. ty!:smile: 
THREAD: <@U213QCKQE>  was there any particular c++ standard that you had to conform to in order to be graded properly? i'm thinking about following c++11 closely and just replace every traditional pointer with smart pointer whenever I can so i don't have to worry about all the new/delete manual memory management nonsense REPLY: I don't even think we'll have to go that deep REPLY: okay i guess this might be something more relevant for CS425 REPLY: It's not the quality of your code, but the output of the program on the dataset we will be mining REPLY: I don't remember having to make that distinction of having to use a certain standard.  
THREAD: Hey there <!here|@here>! Does anyone know a former student of this class I can talk to about workload? I’m considering taking 2 classes this fall, and I’d like to gather data about the sanity of this idea. REPLY: Which two are you planning to take, and have you taken any classes yet to give a frame of reference? Other students report that this is one of the lighter classes compared to some others, but it's hard to know what's right for your schedule. REPLY: Amongst all classes offered; yes, this is one of the lighter classes; but probably the best way to decide for yourself is taking Coursera MOOCs; in its last run; the class was just that - 2 Coursera courses + final project, which was open ended ( effort proportional to your own expectations; class did not set much of them ). So, imo; this class should NOT be taken alone unless someone is really constrained; but coupling it with CS425 or unseen ABM might not be wise.  REPLY: It’s very sane. CS 410 is fairly easy if you are confident in your ability to connect math to application. 
THREAD: I just started reading the book, I'm enjoying it more than I expected.  I already have some ideas on how I can use this at work. REPLY: Is there a syllabus that shows which chapters we need to focus on? REPLY: <@U5FDC7P1A> not that I am aware of at this time.  For CS498 they posted a few days in. 
THREAD: i can not really afford to reschedule it seems - so given 410 apparently does not *focus* on the project  (the way dataviz does) I will go ahead with it.   *Can you confirm that the 410 is more reading-material and concepts driven*? REPLY: In my experience, yes REPLY: so .. was that data viz project rough? or was it *rough* ? REPLY: ? REPLY: rough == difficult
