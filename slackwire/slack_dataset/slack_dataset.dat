THREAD: To help in our preparation for the second exam, I used what I learned in this course in terms of scraping, data cleaning and text summarization to create <https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/gunther6_illinois_edu/EvC5Rwh9g69CnsnJn48-oqcBy5bbwPHHu0ss2p-ZRYJq6g?e=1B4xyu|HERE> the six documents below: •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (full) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Transcripts (summarized) consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) •	Slides consolidated for part 1 (chapters 1 to 6) •	Slides consolidated for part 2 (chapters 7 to 12) For curiosity and if you have interest in summarization (I have a lot), I used a rate of 35% (I tried with lower numbers, but the experience was not so good). This was a good exercise. I tried different extractive and abstractive summarization algos, including some packages already available in Python and pre-existing models. Abstractive is the future, specially the different HuggingFace Transform algorithms, but it requires much more study, analysis, and tuning to find the right parameters for big text such as transcripts (it would be a good exercise after the exams). After testing different extractive options I decided to use a step by step process using NLTK and PageRank: pre-processing, word and sentence embedding, padding, similarity matrix, cosine distance and PageRank for the sentences. Feel free to provide feedback about the summarized results. REPLY: I'm curious about a few things.  1) Are the transcripts un-edited, i.e. straight from Coursera? 2)  Does the summarization make new statements, eliminate redundant statements in the transcripts, or something else? 3) Do the summaries still follow the sequence of slides? REPLY: Follow my comments: 1-) Yes  2-) it is an extractive algorithm. With giant texts such as transcripts I got better results (so far) using extraction instead of abstractive (generating new sentences)  3-) Yes, it follows the sequence of slides REPLY: Hopefully someone has extra time to give you feedback. REPLY: <@U016V2VURUH> I took this class a couple years ago and my final project was also based on summarisation :slightly_smiling_face: . I had used TextRank which is based on PageRank for extractive summarisation. Also, you are right, for longer texts extractive approaches give better results but its also dependent to some extent on the datatset. I am in NLP at the moment writing a HW review paper on the recent advances in abstractive summarisation. REPLY: <@UM1KDMWG0> this is a great topic and I am interested to learn more. 
THREAD: it is meant to be a completion mark i think... lol don't expect extensive reviews ? REPLY: Oh, sure. But this is what I got: 
THREAD: Curious to know, how long is your progress report and how far you are in percentage? REPLY: Here’s an example for mine: <https://github.com/benpcorn/CourseProject/blob/main/Progress_Report.md>  1 page ish. I’m probably 40% through the project 
THREAD: Has anyone emailed the professor before and got a response? or He doesn't usually respond? REPLY: I've asked about grade reports before and got a response in a reasonable amount of time (day). REPLY: I did not get response by email, but got the result reflected in coursera in reasonable time REPLY: Second. He did respond to me last week. REPLY: I emailed him about an issue and got a response super quickly 
THREAD: The technical review is due Sunday or Monday? the reason for question is that the deadlines are usually Sunday but this one seems Monday? REPLY: For me, Coursera is still showing Nov 7 11:59 CST.  If you are seeing a different date I would confirm with TAs/Prof REPLY: Yup I see Monday Nov 8 REPLY: <@U0123KZL1EG> Do check the time as well.. It might be showing 8th Nov as you might be in different time zone than CST.... All the deadlines are CST based... so its actually 7th November 11:59 PM CST.... Which is 8th Nov 12:59 AM EST and so on....
